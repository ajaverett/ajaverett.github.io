The [Wilford Woodruff Papers](https://wilfordwoodruffpapers.org/) is a collection of documents from the life of Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Mormon Church. The collection contains over 100,000 documents, including journals, letters, and other documents.

**The Challenge and Solution**

The challenge was to create a tool that would match the entire corpus of Mormon scripture to the Wilford Woodruff Papers. 

My team was able to deliver an interactive web application that cross-referenced religious texts with 19th century published journal entries by using a Bag-of-Words model to vectorize n-grams to find textual matches sorted by confidence

Packages Used:

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)... plus a few others

**The Result**
