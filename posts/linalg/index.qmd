The Invertible Matrix Theorem in Parts

**Let $A$ be an $(n\times m)$ matrix where $n\leq m$**  

If there are pivots in every column of $A$:

 - The columns of A make up a linearly independent set

 - The equation, $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ has only the trivial solution

 - The linear transformation $\vec{x} \rightarrow A\vec{x}$ is *one-to-one*, or injective

 - The rows of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$

 - There exists an $(n\times m)$ matrix $C$ such that $CA=I_n$

**Let $A$ be an $(n\times m)$ matrix where $n\geq m$**

If there are pivots in every row of $A$:

 - The rows of $A$ make up a linearly independent set

 - The equation, $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has at least one solution for every $\vec{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$
 
 - The linear transformation $\vec{x} \rightarrow A\vec{x}$ maps $\mathbb{R}^m$ *onto* $\mathbb{R}^n$, or is surjective

 - The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$

 - There exists an $(n\times m)$ matrix $D$ such that $AD=I_m$


**Let $A$ be an $(n\times n)$ matrix**

If there are pivots in every row and column of $A$, then both groups of statements above are true, and:

 - A is an invertible matrix

 - A is row equivalent to $I_n$

 - A has $n$ pivot positions

 - A's left inverse and right inverse are the same matrix

 - The columns of $A$ form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$ 

 - The column space, $\text{Col}\{A\}$, is $\mathbb{R}^n$

 - The rank of $A = \text{Rank}\{A\} = \text{dim}\{\text{Col}\{A\}\} = n$

 - The nullity of $A = \text{Nullity}\{A\} = \text{dim}\{\text{Nul}\{A\}\} = 0$

 - 0 is not an eigenvalue of $A$

 - The determinant of $A$, $\det{A} \neq 0$
