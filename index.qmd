# Passion Projects

### [A Brief Introduction to Statistics](https://ajaverett.github.io/statistics)

I wrote/compiled this book as a way to introduce people to univariate and bivariate data, distributions, and hypothesis testing. I have always been interested in statistics, and I wanted to break down these concepts in a way that was easy to understand but went into enough detail to be useful.

### [A Brief Introduction to Intelligence](https://ajaverett.github.io/intelligence)

I wrote/compiled this book as a way to introduce people to the field of intelligence research and its criticisms. I have always been interested in the field of intelligence research, and I wanted to share my knowledge with others. I also wanted to make a book that was easy but robustly cited.
