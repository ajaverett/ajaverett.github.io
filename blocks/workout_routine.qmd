# Full Body Workout Routine (3-Day Split)

**Overview:** This routine targets every major muscle group with six exercises per session. @carneiro_2024 suggests full-body workouts enhance fat loss by activating more total muscle per workout and ensure balanced growth.

**Schedule:** Perform these workouts on non-consecutive days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri).

## 📅 Workout A
**Focus:** Upper Chest, Squat Pattern, Mid-Back, Hamstring Curl

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Incline Dumbbell Press** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets upper chest. |
| **2. Barbell Squat** | 3 | 6-8 | Targets quads, adductors, glutes. |
| **3. Chest-Supported DB Row** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets mid/upper back. |
| **4. Seated Leg Curl** | 3 | 10-15 | Targets hamstrings (knee flexion). |
| **5. Bicep Curl** (Superset) | 3 | 8-12 | See options below. |
| **6. Tricep Extension** (Superset) | 3 | 8-12 | See options below. |



### 💡 Form & Technique Tips

* **Incline Dumbbell Press:**
    * **Bench Angle:** If you have a flat sternum, use a slight incline (1-2 notches). If you have a steep sternal angle, use a steeper incline. [@chaves_2020]
    * **Elbows:** Tuck elbows into an arrow shape; press up and back towards the collarbone.
    * **Warm-up:** 1 light set (8-10 reps), 1 medium (3-5 reps), 1 heavy (1-2 reps).
* **Squats:**
    * Squats will grow glutes as effectively as other glute focused exercises (hip thrust) but also grow the quads, adductors, and lower back. [@plotkin_2023]
    * **Modifications:** If you struggle to squat deep (long femurs/poor ankle mobility), elevate your heels on plates to target quads more effectively.
    * 
* **Chest-Supported Row:**
    * **Setup:** Set bench to 45°. Keep elbows angled out like an arrow shape. Make sure to not let the biceps take over by squeezing the back keeping forearms perpendicular to the ground.
    * **Intensity Technique:** On the last set, after hitting failure, perform 3–5 partial reps in the bottom (stretched) position.
* **Leg Curl:**
    * **Seated vs. Lying:** Seated is preferred for greater stretch/growth.
    * **Tip:** Stop just short of fully straightening legs to keep tension on hamstrings, not calves.

### 💪 Arms Superset Options
* **Option 1 (Dumbbells):** Lying Incline DB Curls + DB Overhead Extensions.
* **Option 2 (Cables):** Behind-the-body Cable Curls + Overhead Rope Extensions.

## 📅 Workout B
**Focus:** Flat Press, Hinge Pattern, Vertical Pull, Glutes

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Barbell Bench Press** | 3 | 4-6 | Targets mid/lower chest & strength. |
| **2. Romanian Deadlift (RDL)** | 3 | 6-8 | Targets hamstrings (hip extension). |
| **3. Lat Pulldowns** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets lats/upper back width. |
| **4. Walking Lunges** | 3 | 6-10 | Reps are *per leg*. Glute focus. |
| **5. Cable Lateral Raise** (Superset) | 3 | 10-15 | Side delts. |
| **6. Reverse Crunches** (Superset) | 3 | 10-15 | Abdominal focus. |



### 💡 Form & Technique Tips

* **Bench Press:**
    * Heavier weight (lower reps) to boost strength.
    * *Alternative:* Flat Dumbbell Press if the barbell bothers your shoulders.
* **Romanian Deadlift:**
    * **Cue:** Imagine a band around your hips pulling you back. Let the bar slide down your thighs.
    * **Depth:** Stop when your hips stop moving back to avoid rounding the lower back.
* **Lat Pulldowns:**
    * **Grip:** Fairly wide grip, lean back slightly.
    * **Intensity Technique:** On the last set, extend the set with 3–5 partial reps in the stretched position after failure.
* **Walking Lunges:**
    * **Glute Focus:** Take a wide step and lean your torso forward slightly while keeping the back straight.
* **Superset:**
    * **Lateral Raise:** Set cable 3-4 notches up from the bottom for a better resistance profile. Perform behind the back.
    * **Reverse Crunches:** Curl pelvis up towards chest; control the descent.

* **Shoulder Press:**
    * Set bench 1-2 notches down from fully upright (better for joints).

    * 
* **Hip Thrusts:**
    * *Alternative:* Dumbbell Step-ups (lean forward for glutes).
* **Leg Extensions:**
    * Lean back in the seat (if possible) to stretch the rectus femoris for more growth.
* **Cable Flyes:**
    * Place a foam roller behind your back for a deeper stretch.
    * *Alternative:* Pec Deck (add partial reps at the end if using Pec Deck).
* **Superset:**
    * **Calf Raise:** Pause at the bottom for a deep stretch.
    * **Rear Delt Fly:** Set cables slightly above shoulder height; cross arms at the start.

**Progressive Overload:**
Aim to increase weight or reps slightly every week. Ensure you are training close to failure, especially on the final sets.
