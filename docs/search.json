    "text": "About Me\n\nResume\nHere is my resume as of May 2023. I am currently in my senior year at University studying Data Science with a minor in Statistics. I am looking for a full-time position in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Statistics. I am also open to internships.\n\n\nBlog and Portfolio\nI have a blog and portfolio where I post about my projects and other things I find interesting. I am somewhat interested in politics, and other social sciences. I also like to write about my personal projects and other fun things.\n\n\n\nHalf-Baked Passion Projects\n\nA Brief Introduction to Statistics\nI wrote/compiled this book as a way to introduce people to univariate and bivariate data, distributions, and hypothesis testing. I have always been interested in statistics, and I wanted to break down these concepts in a way that was easy to understand but went into enough detail to be useful.\n\n\nA Brief Introduction to Intelligence\nI wrote/compiled this book as a way to introduce people to the field of intelligence research and its criticisms. I have always been interested in the field of intelligence research, and I wanted to share my knowledge with others. I also wanted to make a book that was easy but robustly cited.\n\n\nSome Brief Counters to Heritability\nI compiled this book as a way to counter some common claims against the idea of heritability (ratio of variance explained by genetics to total variation in a given phenotype). Understanding to two fronts to improving a phenotype (genetics and environment) is important to me."
