<p>my housing policy platform.</p>
<p>tldr: i support upzoning (and zoning reform generally, i would like a japanese style, state controlled zoning system with Nuisance restrictions), public rent insurance, borrower based macroprudential limits, foreign-buyer taxes, mandatory savings programs, abolishing parking minimums and min. lot sizes, By-Right approval systems, construction visas, credential recognition reform (i want more pacts, however I actually dont like occup. licensing generally), dismantle the elevator union- ban proprietary maintenance contracts, adopt/harmonize/integrate somehow ISO/European standards not just ASME for elevators, plumbing, electrical etc, capital gains reform on primary residences (replace sec 121 flat exemption with inflation-indexed basis, tax real gains as normal capital gains, allow tax-free rollover into mandatory savings/401k to decouple retirement from asset appreciation and stop ‘homevoter’ incentives) i am against mortgage interest deductions, simple rent control, transaction taxes, homeownership subsidies, tariffs on construction materials, double loaded corridor requirement (legalize point access blocks (single stair buildings) up to 6–8 stories), nepa shit (exempt infill housing from environmental review) i am hesitantly supporting (if feasible) vacancy taxes in some way that would discourage speculative vacancy, some sort of singaporean style government housing for richer people with 99 yr lease in big cities, some sort of finland style of house first- fix you later? not sure how it would work in the usa., would need to see more data, but open to banning (or heavily restricting/regulating) institutional investors from buying starter homes (obv, keep Build-to-Rent regardless), lvt (obviously) but not sure if feasible- maybe enforce that gov. must tax land at a higher rate than improvements and repeal acquisition-value based property tax assessments, or do a Split-Rate Tax??</p>
<section id="the-bundle-of-goods" class="level1">
<h1>The Bundle of Goods</h1>
<p>Housing is unlike any other consumer good. It is not just a physical structure; it is a “bundle” of services that determines a household’s access to education, health, and employment.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="schwartz_2021">(<strong>schwartz_2021?</strong>)</span> identifies three primary goals of U.S. housing policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shelter Quality: Ensuring housing is physically safe and sanitary.</p></li>
<li><p>Affordability: Ensuring households do not spend excessive income on rent/mortgage.</p></li>
<li><p>Neighborhood Quality: Ensuring access to opportunity and freedom from environmental hazards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Almost every policy failure in housing stems from a single contradiction: housing is both a social necessity (shelter) and a financial vehicle (wealth). Policies that boost the “wealth” aspect (rising prices) inevitably harm the “shelter” aspect (affordability).</p>
<p>The Fundamental Tension: Tenure The US housing system is defined by its “tenure” divide—the legal status of ownership versus renting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Homeowners (approx. 66%): Heavily subsidized through the tax code (Wealth building).</p></li>
<li><p>Renters (approx. 34%): Lower average incomes, subsidized primarily through limited safety nets (Shelter).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because federal policy heavily incentivizes ownership as the primary vehicle for middle-class wealth accumulation, it often conflicts with the goal of affordability. When housing values rise, owners win (wealth effect) but renters lose (affordability crisis).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Housing occupies a particular role in economic policy because it represents both a store of wealth for the owner and a social good that is necessary for the well-being of a community… The policy dilemma faced by governments is how to support the supply of housing as an essential service without disrupting the efficient operation of the property market.” <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="hodgson_2024">(Hodgson, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<section id="the-financial-architecture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-financial-architecture">The Financial Architecture</h2>
<p>To understand modern housing policy, one must understand the financial plumbing that allows lenders to issue loans. The U.S. system is unique globally due to the heavy involvement of the federal government in the mortgage market.</p>
<p><strong>The Secondary Mortgage Market</strong></p>
<p>In the early 20th century, mortgages were short-term (5 years) and required 50% down payments. If the bank ran out of cash, lending stopped. The government intervened to create a “Secondary Market” to ensure credit always flows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Originator: A local bank gives a homebuyer a loan.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sale: The bank sells that loan to a Government-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>The Resupply: The bank now has fresh cash to lend to a new homebuyer.</p></li>
<li><p>The Security: The GSE bundles thousands of these loans into a Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS) and sells them to investors worldwide.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Why this matters: This government-backed cycle creates the “30-year fixed-rate mortgage.” Without government guarantees (Fannie/Freddie), private banks would likely only offer adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to protect themselves from inflation risk.</p>

<section id="rent-control" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rent-control">Rent Control</h2>
<p><em>Regulations protecting tenants from rental increases, including rent freezes and caps on rent growth</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The most prominent effects of rent control are decline of rents for controlled dwellings, reduced residential mobility, lower construction, lower quality of housing, higher rents for uncontrolled dwellings, and lower property prices. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 14)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Not all rent control is created equal: The Three Generations</strong></p>
<p>To understand the economic impact of rent control, one must distinguish between the blunt instruments of the past and modern stabilization efforts. Economists generally classify these policies into three distinct generations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Generation (“Hard Control”):</strong> Absolute rent freezes. Common during wartime, these are universally condemned by economists for destroying the quality and quantity of the housing stock.</li>
<li><strong>Second Generation (“Soft Control”):</strong> Rent <em>stabilization</em> that allows periodic increases (often linked to inflation) to cover maintenance costs (e.g., New York City).</li>
<li><strong>Third Generation (“Tenancy Control”):</strong> The most common modern form in Europe (e.g., Germany). Rents are market-rate for <em>new</em> tenants but capped for <em>sitting</em> tenants to prevent economic eviction.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[F]irst-generation rent controls… lead to a significant fall in real rents… [and] low-rent property in poor and deteriorating condition… [However], third-generation rent controls… [where] rent increases are controlled within a tenancy but unrestricted between tenancies… [aim to] smooth out rent changes for tenants, while maintaining a competitive long-term rate of return for landlords. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="haffner_2024">(Haffner &amp; Hulse, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The “Insider-Outsider” Problem</strong></p>
<p>While Third Generation controls avoid the worst supply shocks, they create a distinct labor market distortion known as the “Insider-Outsider” problem.</p>
<p>“Insiders” (current tenants protected by caps) gain stability and below-market rents. However, this comes at the direct expense of “Outsiders” (young families, immigrants, or workers moving for jobs), who face a shrinking pool of units and significantly higher prices in the unregulated sector.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[I]nsiders (current tenants) gain at the cost of outsiders (prospective tenants)… [T]he beneficiaries from… rent controls are longer term tenants… who tend to be older, while the potential costs are born by new households who have to access housing through the unregulated market. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="haffner_2024">(Haffner &amp; Hulse, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The “Lock-In” Effect</strong></p>
<p>This disparity creates a “lock-in” effect. Tenants become prisoners of their cheap leases, refusing to move even if their family outgrows the unit or a better job awaits in another city. This creates a housing mismatch: an elderly widow might stay in a large family apartment because it is cheap, while a young family is squeezed into a small unit.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The impact on residential mobility appears to be quite clear: nearly all studies indicate a negative effect… Reduced residential mobility translates to less adaptable responses to shifts in the labor market. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2024">(Kholodilin, 2024, p. 5)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By reducing the turnover of rental stock, rent control creates queues that make renting unviable, inadvertently forcing households into the buyer market even if they would prefer to rent.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rent controls… can create “lock-in” effects where renters remain in space that may exceed their needs, reducing the effective housing supply and creating queues that make renting a less viable alternative. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="geng_2018">(Geng, 2018, p. 12)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Price ceilings act as quality ceilings</strong></p>
<p>For First and Second Generation controls that do not allow sufficient increases, the most immediate effect is physical deterioration. When landlords cannot raise rents to cover rising maintenance costs, they simply stop fixing things.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The published studies are almost unanimous… rent control leads to a deterioration in the quality of those dwellings subject to regulations. The landlords, whose revenues are eroded by rent control, have reduced incentives to invest in maintenance and refurbishment, thus they let their properties wear out. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2024">(Kholodilin, 2024, p. 6)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Spillover Effects: Hurting the uncontrolled sector</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to the goal of affordability, rent control often raises prices for everyone else. By limiting supply and turnover, it puts upward pressure on the unregulated market. Studies show an average 4.8% rent increase for uncontrolled dwellings in cities with rent control regimes.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As a rule, rent control leads to higher rents for uncontrolled dwellings. The average effect of rent control on… uncontrolled rents is 4.8%. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2024">(Kholodilin, 2024, p. 5)</span></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Exempting new builds can save supply incentives</strong></p>
<p>To prevent the construction industry from halting new projects, modern policies often exempt newly built properties. This allows “Second Generation” controls to protect existing tenants without discouraging future supply.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[M]ore recent rent control policies often exempt newly built properties from regulation in order to preserve developer incentives. This exemption appears to work: Mense et al.&nbsp;(2023) find no immediate decline in construction in Germany… In this sense, the design of modern policies—by excluding new construction—can encourage, rather than discourage, future investment. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="segu_2025">(Segu &amp; Jofre-Monseny, 2025, p. 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Trade-off: Price vs.&nbsp;Security</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, the most successful modern policies frame the issue not as price control, but as “security of tenure.” Instead of capping rents at artificial levels, the law restricts <em>evictions</em>. This allows landlords to make a reasonable profit (encouraging supply) while preventing them from evicting tenants arbitrarily just to reset the rent.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[R]ent regulation in a broader sense includes… various types of regulation which prescribe tenancy conditions… such as rules on termination of tenancies. This is understandable from the point of view that rent control will not work, if there is no protection from eviction. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="haffner_2024">(Haffner &amp; Hulse, 2024)</span></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Likewise, the number of studies on housing rationing is small. They find a negative effect on property prices.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-allowances">Housing Allowances</h2>
<p><em>State subsidies paid to low-income households or landlords to cover housing costs</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The numbers of studies that find positive and negative effects [about housing allowances on employment] are comparable, while the largest group of studies did not find any statistically significant effects… The housing allowances appear to increase rents… The housing allowances also seem to not just improve neighbourhood and housing quality but also increase housing size. They positively contribute to the mental health. Housing benefits can also lead to smaller household sizes by allowing the women to leave their partners in case of conflicts, since they are become less financially dependent. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 15)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A major structural flaw in housing allowances is the “withdrawal rate.” Because these benefits are means-tested, the subsidy shrinks as the tenant earns more money. This effectively acts as a high marginal tax rate on low-income workers, punishing them for increasing their hours or finding better jobs.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>With means-tested benefits, the marginal rate of benefit withdrawal can make a significant contribution to the overall marginal rate of tax low-income households face influencing their labour-leisure… and savings decisions. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="stephens_2024">(Stephens &amp; Gibb, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A major criticism of rental subsidies is that landlords simply raise rents to absorb the government cash (capitalization), however, some evidence suggests that if the policy is designed correctly,(specifically, if it targets only the most vulnerable rather than a broad swath of the population) inflationary effects are minimized.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[T]he third mechanism-relating capitalization to the proportion of tenants eligible for subsidies-has a clear policy implication: extending subsidies to higher-income groups increases policy costs and reduces effectiveness. Therefore, to be effective, rental assistance should be targeted toward the most vulnerable households. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="segu_2025">(Segu &amp; Jofre-Monseny, 2025, p. 15)</span></p>

<section id="provision-of-social-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="provision-of-social-housing">Provision of Social Housing</h2>
<p><em>Provision of state-subsidized rental or owner-occupied housing for low-income households</em></p>
<p>Critics of social housing often point to labor market distortions. Evidence suggests that in-kind housing subsidies can reduce the motivation to seek employment.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Similarly, the most prominent effect of social, or public, housing seems to be the reduction of employment. Again, it is thought that in-kind subsidies, such as social housing, diminish incentives of its receivers to work. Interestingly, unlike the case of housing allowances, social housing appears to exert no positive price effects, probably due to its in-kind nature. Nevertheless, the number of studies is very limited, which undermines the reliability of these findings. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some evidence shows that this perceived “employment gap” is largely a statistical illusion caused by selection bias. Because social housing systems specifically target the most disadvantaged (the “ambulance service” model), they naturally house people with lower employment prospects. When researchers control for personal characteristics, the “lazy tenant” effect largely disappears.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[W]orking-age social tenants… have far lower rates of employment… [but] once we control for the personal factors and composition of the social housing sector, these differentials largely… disappear. The implication is that the redistributive purpose of social housing… will create these differentials… but there is nothing intrinsically anti-work in social housing. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="stephens_2024">(Stephens &amp; Gibb, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, shifting from direct state provision to a market-facilitator role (privatization) often creates a void in the welfare system that the market does not fill, exacerbating inequality.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Privatised public housing… potentially reshapes the local welfare system… [The] decline in and subsequent privatisation of public housing production have rendered it unaffordable for low-income groups… [This process] limited the number of low-cost housing units for the urban poor… [and] inevitably leads to inequality between higher- and lower-income groups. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="rehman_2023">(Rehman et al., 2023, p. 42)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While critics focus on labor market distortions, proponents argue that social housing generates value through “avoided costs” in other public budgets. By stabilizing vulnerable households, housing acts as upstream prevention for downstream problems like homelessness, poor health, and criminal justice involvement.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Additional] social housing reduces the demand for homelessness services… [and] improves health and educational outcomes so that there are less claims to be made on future health budgets… These outcomes may also enhance future economic productivity. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="gibb_2024">(Gibb &amp; Christie, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a major barrier to this policy is that these savings are often not “cashable.” Because government budgets are siloed, the Housing Ministry pays for the construction, but the Health Ministry reaps the savings, making the financial case difficult to prove in standard investment appraisals.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A reasonable case can be carefully made for the accounting savings… [but] that does not mean it is realisable as cashable savings… Budget holders typically do not want their notional future budgets cut because of successes now in other departments. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="gibb_2024">(Gibb &amp; Christie, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A classic economic critique of social housing is “deadweight loss”—the idea that for every home the government builds, the private sector builds one less. However, recent appraisal guidance suggests this displacement is not 1:1. In markets with weak demand or capacity constraints, government intervention is often “additional.”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[UK government] investment appraisal guidance concludes that affordable housing supply is 50%–100% additional i.e.&nbsp;it is not mainly deadweight that would displace market housing… [W]here there is also plentiful land [and] unused construction capacity… then grant-funded affordable housing investment should be near to 100% additional. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="gibb_2024">(Gibb &amp; Christie, 2024, p. 18)</span></p>

<section id="mortgage-interest-deduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mortgage-interest-deduction">Mortgage Interest Deduction</h2>
<p><em>Tax policy allowing homeowners to deduct interest payments from taxable income to encourage homeownership</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Although it appears to not affect homeownership, it does lead to rising prices… There are some studies showing an improvement in the housing size and construction, but there are also studies that show negative welfare effects. All in all, most empirical studies conclude that mortgage interest deduction fails to achieve its objective. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, favoring housing investment via the tax code distorts the broader economy. By incentivizing over-investment in real estate, these policies divert capital away from more productive industries while encouraging households to take on dangerous levels of debt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[F]avorable tax treatment on housing investment may crowd out capital from more productive use than housing and encourage excessive leverage… This tax relief tends to be capitalized into house prices, without necessarily expanding housing opportunities for households. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="geng_2018">(Geng, 2018, p. 11)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By subsidizing borrowing costs, it increases demand. In markets where supply is tight (inelastic), this simply inflates prices rather than spurring construction.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Recent years have seen a growing body of literature that challenges the notion of the MID’s positive effect on homeownership rates… [In fact,] in land-constrained jurisdictions, the MID reduces homeownership. In highly constrained markets… the MID decreases homeownership due to the high level of MID capitalization into housing prices. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="valentin_2024">(Valentin, 2024, p. 12)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tax deductions like the MID disproportionately benefit the wealthy. High-income households have larger mortgages (and thus more interest to deduct) and face higher marginal tax rates (making the deduction worth more). Furthermore, lower-income households often claim the “standard deduction” rather than itemizing, meaning they receive zero benefit from the policy while still paying higher prices caused by the market inflation it generates.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[T]he monetary benefits of housing deductions have been described as regressive in several studies… Fatica and Prammer (2018) confirm the regressivity… [finding] that the MID in Belgium reduces the cost of ownership by 1.14% for households in the lowest income quintile but by 5.83% for those in the highest. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="valentin_2023">(<strong>valentin_2023?</strong>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the MID is regressive, inflationary, and distorts the economy, why does it persist? The answer lies in the “short-run wealth shock.” Because the subsidy is already baked (capitalized) into current home prices, removing it would cause an immediate drop in property values. This would harm current middle-class homeowners, creating a massive political barrier to reform despite the long-term welfare gains.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Despite the economic arguments supporting their discontinuation… housing deductions’ detrimental effects on household wealth in the short-run pose significant obstacles… [N]o more than 40% of households would prefer to repeal the MID because of the negative shock on housing equity it would trigger. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="valentin_2023">(<strong>valentin_2023?</strong>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impact of the deduction depends entirely on “supply elasticity” (how easy it is to build). In markets with strict zoning, the tax break is fully absorbed by price increases. It effectively only boosts homeownership in areas where land use regulation is lax.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[C]apitalization of the interest and property tax deductions [depends on] the elasticity of housing supply… [O]nly in markets with lax land use regulation does the mortgage interest deduction (MID) have a positive impact on homeownership attainment… In tightly regulated markets, the MID reduces the likelihood of homeownership for all income groups except the lowest. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="bourassa_2015">(Bourassa et al., 2015, p. 203)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To understand why the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID) is considered a distortion, one must understand “Tax Neutrality.” In a neutral system, the tax code treats a homeowner exactly like a landlord renting to themselves.</p>
<p>If a landlord gets to deduct mortgage interest (business expense), they must also pay taxes on the rent they receive (business income). However, the owner-occupier gets to deduct the expense without paying tax on the benefit they receive (the value of living rent-free, known as “Imputed Rent”).</p>
<p>By allowing the deduction without taxing the imputed income, the tax code heavily subsidizes ownership over renting.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A neutral tax system would ensure that the owner would face a similar tax outcome regardless of how the property is used… Tax neutrality is achieved if an owner-occupier is taxed on an amount equivalent to the rent that an investor would have received [and both] claim the same tax concessions. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="hodgson_2024">(Hodgson, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, only a handful of countries (such as the Netherlands and Switzerland) attempt to balance this by taxing imputed rent, making their systems more neutral but politically unpopular.</p>

<p>The two major effects of homeownership subsidies that are considered in the empirical literature are property prices and urban sprawl. Both seem to be increased by the subsidies <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond inflationary pressure, evidence suggests that these subsidies often fail to expand the total pool of homeowners. Instead, they simply encourage households to buy earlier than they otherwise would have (an intertemporal shift), effectively subsidizing people who were already on the path to ownership.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-codes">Building Codes</h2>
<p><em>Regulations regarding structural safety, fire safety, sanitation, and energy efficiency</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The two most prominent effects of building codes are increasing property prices and reducing electricity consumption. The price increases can be explained by two factors… stronger restrictions on building standards drive up construction costs [and second] higher quality [amenities are] eventually (albeit probably not completely) capitalized in the real estate prices. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike zoning restrictions which often serve to protect aesthetics or property values, building codes present a distinct welfare trade-off. While they raise costs, the safety benefits may justify the expense in a way that supply restrictions do not.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While… regulations could still improve welfare, on net, if the utility that they provide outweighs the higher cost of housing. For example, some building codes may provide a net welfare gain, as they ensure the safety and soundness of structures. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_2020">(Molloy, 2020, p. 12)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While ownership is often framed as a wealth-building tool, low-income households typically enter the market through “filtering”—buying older, depreciated housing stock. This creates a regressive maintenance burden: the poorest homeowners often live in the worst conditions yet must spend a higher percentage of their income on repairs than wealthier owners.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[H]ouseholds in the lowest income quintile are three times more likely to live in housing in need of modernization… Although their dwellings often are in worse shape, low-income groups still spend a larger proportion of their income on maintenance than wealthier households. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="atterhog_2009">(<strong>atterhog_2009?</strong>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When evaluating the cost-benefit analysis of retrofitting older homes, counting only “energy savings” often results in a weak financial case. However, when the “co-benefits” of health are monetized—specifically reductions in asthma, respiratory disease, and excess winter deaths—the return on investment becomes highly positive.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[A lack of insulation or ventilation] is linked to chronic respiratory diseases… [Studies find] that total benefits in “present value”… are one and a half to two times the magnitude of the cost of retrofitting insulation… [due to] reduced number of visits to doctors, cases of hospitalisations, [and] days off school. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="nanda_2024">(Nanda, 2024)</span></p>

<section id="land-use-regulations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="land-use-regulations">Land Use Regulations</h2>
<p><em>Zoning laws, density restrictions, urban growth boundaries, and minimum lot sizes</em></p>
<p>Zoning does not restrict all housing equally; it disproportionately restricts the multifamily apartments that low-income renters rely on, biasing the market toward expensive single-family homes.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[M]ore regulated areas tend to have a larger share of single-family construction, suggesting that regulation restricts the supply of multifamily structures more than the supply of single-family structures… [This] prevents the construction of smaller homes that are more suitable to… migrants who would have otherwise moved into the area in response to the income shock. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_2020">(Molloy, 2020, p. 4)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regulations are often pitched as a way to protect neighborhood character, and evidence suggests they succeed in creating amenities. However, this comes at the direct expense of supply, creating a “shortage by design” that inflates prices.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Land use policies increase property prices and diminish residential construction. On the one hand, by restricting construction they create a shortage of housing, thus, inflating prices. This means a worse affordability of housing. On the other hand, this effect results from the policies creating amenities and improving the neighbourhood quality. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond just higher prices, strict zoning creates a structural financial vulnerability. In markets where supply is constrained (inelastic), prices cannot adjust gradually to economic shifts. Instead, they become hypersensitive to central bank policy, leading to sharper boom-and-bust cycles.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The regional heterogeneity can be partially explained by changes in housing supply, that is, where land is more expensive, house prices are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates… The heterogeneity of policy response is significantly correlated with… housing supply elasticity. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_2023">(Zhao &amp; Liu, 2023, p. 7)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Asymmetry of Reform</strong></p>
<p>Most importantly, longitudinal data reveals that zoning reforms are not symmetrical. While tightening restrictions (downzoning) has immediate negative impacts on the middle class, loosening them (upzoning) is a slower fix that filters down from the top.</p>
<p>Reforms that tighten restrictions have a direct, statistically significant negative impact on middle-income affordability:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Reforms that increase land-use restrictions and lower allowed densities are associated with increased median rents and a reduction in units affordable to middle-income renters. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="stacy_2023">(Stacy et al., 2023, p. 1)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conversely, reforms that loosen restrictions (upzoning) do successfully add supply (0.8% increase), but this supply materializes slowly (3–9 years) and primarily at the upper end of the price spectrum.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We find that reforms that loosen restrictions are associated with a statistically significant 0.8% increase in housing supply within three to nine years… This increase occurs predominantly for units at the higher end of the rent price distribution. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="stacy_2023">(Stacy et al., 2023, p. 1)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The “Implementation Gap”: Why permissions don’t always equal homes</strong></p>
<p>A common assumption in housing economics is that if you remove planning constraints, supply will instantly follow. However, critics argue that the “supply side” is often constrained by factors totally unrelated to zoning, such as skills shortages, material costs, or strategic behavior by developers (land banking).</p>
<p>This creates an “implementation gap” between the number of units permitted and the number actually built.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[T]he supply side… is under-specified… [T]here is a significant “implementation gap” between planning permission being secured and development taking place… [M]odels… [often] assume that planning permissions will be translated into new homes more quickly and at a higher rate than is likely to be possible or desirable from the builder’s perspective. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="obrien_2024">(O’Brien et al., 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, while deregulation is a necessary condition for supply, it is not a sufficient one if the construction industry lacks the capacity to scale up.</p>
<p><strong>Zoning Architectures: Conformative vs.&nbsp;Performative</strong> <em>Not all zoning is created equal. The economic impact depends heavily on whether the system prioritizes “Certainty” or “Flexibility.”</em></p>
<p><em>Euclidean Zoning (The US Model)</em> Named after the Supreme Court case <em>Euclid v. Ambler</em>, this system separates uses rigidly (e.g., residential vs.&nbsp;commercial). It provides high <strong>certainty</strong> (neighbors know exactly what can be built) but low <strong>flexibility</strong>, making it difficult to adapt land to changing economic needs.</p>
<p><em>The Japanese Model (Maximum Elasticity)</em> Japan utilizes a zoning system that allows a high mix of uses and densities by default. It offers both flexibility <em>and</em> the “right to build” (certainty). While this results in a “disordered” urban form, it creates a highly elastic housing supply that keeps prices stable during booms.</p>
<p><em>The German Model (Negotiated Flexibility)</em> Germany uses a “performative” approach. Plans offer flexibility regarding density and mix (allowing adaptation), but developers face uncertainty regarding the final form, which is often negotiated with the local authority.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the USA, zoning is typically inflexible with regard to land use… but provides a high degree of certainty… In Germany… zonal plans tend to offer flexibility to develop at higher densities… but developers face significant uncertainty for the final form… [In Japan], zonal plans offer flexibility regarding mix… but confer the right to develop… [offering] benefits with respect to ease of development. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="obrien_2024">(O’Brien et al., 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulations distort demographics by forcing lower-income households to leave</strong></p>
<p>Standard affordability metrics often understate the crisis in highly regulated cities. This is because high costs cause “sorting”—lower-income households simply move away (or never move in). By expelling the poor, regulated cities effectively export their poverty statistics to other regions.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[A] regulation that raises housing costs may cause fewer poor households to move in and more poor households to move out. Thus, the regulation can alter the local distribution of income… household sorting can affect traditional measures of housing affordability. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_2020">(Molloy, 2020, pp. 8–9)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The “Green” Zoning Paradox</strong></p>
<p>Local zoning is often defended on environmental grounds (preserving open space or limiting “overcrowding”). However, when productive, temperate coastal cities restrict growth, they force migration to less temperate, car-dependent regions. This results in a net increase in total carbon emissions.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[R]estricting… housing… in coastal cities may force people to move to more affordable, less constrained but higher carbon footprint areas. Such dynamics may lead to an adverse and unintended consequence of local land-use policy… [inadvertently] adding to the risks of climate change. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="nanda_2024">(Nanda, 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strict density controls often force development to the periphery. While the housing itself might appear cheaper, the total cost of living remains high once commuting is factored in.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If regulation pushes construction to areas that are farther from jobs, the total cost of living for the typical household will be higher because they face higher commuting costs… density controls and height restrictions tend to increase urban sprawl. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="molloy_2020">(Molloy, 2020, p. 10)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The “Streetlight Effect” in Housing Economics</strong></p>
<p>Finally, there is a methodological bias in how we evaluate planning. It is easy to measure the <em>costs</em> of regulation (higher house prices), but very difficult to measure the <em>benefits</em> (the absence of noise pollution, the value of coordinated infrastructure, or heritage preservation).</p>
<p>Because costs are quantitative and benefits are qualitative, economic models often overstate the net harm of regulation. They act as “a series of facts looking for a theory,” focusing on price inflation while ignoring the market failures (externalities) that zoning was invented to solve.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[N]o-one would be, or should be, surprised that regulations raise house prices… what is at issue is how much they raise prices, compared with what benefits they confer… [Economists must] seek to apply the same degree of rigour… to the measurement of costs [as to benefits]. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="obrien_2024">(O’Brien et al., 2024)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Consumer preference sometimes contradicts New Urbanist planning goals</strong></p>
<p>While planners often advocate for high-density and connected street grids to reduce sprawl, a meta-analysis of 139 analyses shows that the market often penalizes these features. Consumers frequently pay a premium for lower density and disconnected streets (cul-de-sacs).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[A] high density… is likely to decrease individual housing prices… The calculated mean coefficient was statistically significant by the effect size (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r">) of .04 [indicating a negative relationship]… Having a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood has been shown to have a positive effect on housing premiums… (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%20.05">)… [whereas] street density… was negatively related to housing values (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%20-.02">). <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="park_2016">(Park et al., 2016, pp. 3, 6, 7)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This creates a tension where zoning for density may lower per-unit housing costs not just by increasing supply, but because buyers simply prefer lower-density environments.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[P]eople are less likely to invest in houses in higher density neighborhoods… high density can be perceived as a crowded environment and prone to causing stress… [P]eople still value large lots, lower density… and secluded space with less connected streets over most New Urbanism principles. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="park_2016">(Park et al., 2016, pp. 7, 9)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proximity to institutional land uses (like schools or government buildings) tends to increase housing values, while proximity to industrial uses decreases them. However, generic “mixed-use” zoning does not automatically generate value.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Being closer to institutional land uses increases housing premiums… [However] a large distribution of industrial land uses has negative effects… The larger the industrial land use, the lower the housing values (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%20-.09">)… Commercial land use showed insignificant effects (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%20.00">). <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="park_2016">(Park et al., 2016, pp. 5, 7)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While urbanists often promote mixed-use developments as a way to increase value and walkability, the actual market data is highly conflicted. The “premium” depends entirely on the specific type of non-residential use.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mixed land use was reported as both a positive and a negative condition… Being closer to institutional land uses [like schools] increases housing premiums… [while] a large distribution of industrial land uses has negative effects… Commercial land use showed insignificant effects (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%20=%20.00">). <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="park_2016">(Park et al., 2016, pp. 3, 5, 7)</span></p>

<p><em>Policies promoting energy-saving measures, such as insulation or solar battery installation</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>While the effect of direct subsidies can be mixed, evidence suggests that informational policies—specifically Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and “Energy Star” labels—successfully capitalize energy savings into asset prices.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Eichholtz et al.&nbsp;find that for 2004–2007 US buildings with an Energy Star label rent for approximately 3% more per square foot than comparable buildings that lack the label.

</blockquote>
<p>A major barrier to sustainability in the rental sector is the “split incentive” (or principal-agent problem). If the tenant pays the utility bills, the landlord has zero financial incentive to install efficient windows or insulation. Conversely, because tenants move frequently, they have no incentive to invest in capital improvements for a property they do not own.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[I]f the renter pays the utility bills, then the landlord has little incentive to invest in energy-efficient measures… [and] since renters do not tend to have long-term motivations… they are unlikely to upgrade… [This leads to] poor housing conditions and [renters] face prohibitive resource constraints. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="nanda_2024">(Nanda, 2024)</span></p>

<p><strong>Transit-Oriented Development</strong></p>
<p><em>Development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>While some argue transaction taxes curb speculation, other scholars argue they gum up the gears of the labor market.

<p><em>Policies aimed at borrowers’ leverage and financial positions, including caps on debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and amortization requirements</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Borrower-targeted macroprudential regulations like LTV (Loan-to-Value) and DTI (Debt-to-Income) limits are effective for stability, and are among the only policies that work in both the short and long term.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Macro-prudential policies can effectively restrain house prices and household credit growth in both the short and long terms… Borrower-based regulatory policies, such as reducing LTV or DTI limits, can effectively curb housing booms. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_2023">(Zhao &amp; Liu, 2023, p. 7)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By restricting the flow of credit rather than the price of the asset, these policies are effective at cooling demand without distorting the construction market as severely as price controls.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Changes in down-payment requirements effectively dampen house price cycles… Credit availability can be reduced and leveraged to ease the housing price cycle. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_2023">(Zhao &amp; Liu, 2023, p. 7)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These restrictions are effective largely because they interrupt the “financial accelerator” mechanism. In a standard cycle, rising home prices allow borrowers to take on more debt (since their collateral is worth more). They then use this increased borrowing power to bid up prices further, creating a self-reinforcing loop.</p>
<p>By capping the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, policymakers attempt to limit this feedback loop, preventing asset price inflation from automatically translating into higher leverage.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[M]uch of the existing research… documents a positive relationship between limits on LTV or debt-to-income (DTI) ratios… and house price dynamics. This link is found to be significant in both industrial and emerging market countries… [T]here is some evidence that they affect the financial accelerator mechanism, to the extent that they influence the procyclicality of debt capacity through a collateral constraint. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="galati_2013">(Galati &amp; Moessner, 2013, p. 860)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a strict LTV ratio is only as effective as the valuation method used to calculate it. If banks use the current market price to calculate LTV during a bubble, the borrower’s borrowing power still rises with the bubble, undermining the policy.</p>
<p>Evidence from Germany suggests a more robust approach: calculating LTV based on a conservative “mortgage lending value” rather than the volatile spot price. By ignoring temporary spikes in market value, this method effectively freezes the credit cycle, preventing the “wealth effect” of a bubble from fueling further borrowing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[T]he real estate market in Germany remained stable because… bank loans were determined based on the minimum value of real estate instead of the market price; this prevented the periodicity of lending.&gt; <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_2023">(Zhao &amp; Liu, 2023, p. 10)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A major barrier to ownership is the “down-payment constraint”—the need for accumulated wealth. While some markets (like the US) addressed this by lowering down-payment requirements (increasing risk), others (like Germany and France) utilize contractual savings schemes (e.g., Bausparkassen).</p>
<p>These programs require households to save a specific amount over several years before accessing a loan. This allows low-income households to “signal” their creditworthiness through discipline rather than existing wealth, allowing lenders to safely offer loans to those with lower incomes.</p>

<p>Households can signal low credit risks by participating in savings plans… [T]he Bausparkassen system with its requirement that potential borrowers must accumulate savings before being eligible for a loan might help lenders to separate good and bad credit risks… Having access to such information can improve home ownership opportunity for a marginal mortgage applicant since the lender might not otherwise know that he/she is a good mortgage prospect. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="atterhog_2009">(<strong>atterhog_2009?</strong>)</span></p>

<p>While broad LTV caps stabilize the market, lowering down payment requirements is the single most effective tool for helping young households enter the market. The impact of these constraints is highly age-dependent.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[A] reduction of the required down payment would increase homeownership with the increases being greater for younger individuals… The implied impact of a decrease in the required down payment from 40% to 20% is an increase in the ownership rate of 20… percentage points for the [26 to 35] age group… [but for] the 46 to 55 age group [the effect is] effectively zero. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="bourassa_2015">(Bourassa et al., 2015, p. 204)</span></p>

<p>However, not all institutional regulations act solely as drags on the market. There is some evidence that “dynamic provisioning”, forcing banks to build up buffers during economic booms to draw down during busts, helps sever the link between lending cycles and bank failures.Evidence from Spain’s implementation suggests that while this tool creates a safety net, it does not necessarily choke off credit supply during the boom, effectively acting as a shield rather than a brake.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fiscal-policy">Fiscal Policy</h2>
<p><em>Government use of spending and taxation to influence economic conditions and aggregate demand</em></p>
<p>When the government spends heavily, it competes for the same labor and materials as private developers (“crowding out”) and drives up interest rates. This makes it harder for the private sector to build housing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Fiscal policy appears to positively affect property prices, while negatively affecting residential construction. The first effect can be explained by the inflationary impact of government expenditure, whereas the second effect is possibly related to the crowding out of the government consumption. An expansionary fiscal policy triggers increases in both prices and interest rates. Consequently, private investors face heightened costs, leading to a reduced willingness to build <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 19)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposing literature argues that housing investment is not merely inflationary but acts as a high-powered economic multiplier. Because construction relies on domestic supply chains and labor, it generates significant tax revenue and employment that can offset the initial public cost.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[I]nvestment across housing tenures has varying impacts but, specifically, social housing investment can improve the lives of tenant households… [Estimates suggest that building 100,000 homes] would generate £1.1 billion in capital spend, £13.6 billion more in economic output, 430,000 FTEs [Full Time Equivalent jobs] and £432 million in extra local infrastructure investment. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="gibb_2024">(Gibb &amp; Christie, 2024, p. 17)</span></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monetary-policy">Monetary Policy</h2>
<p><em>Central bank actions managing interest rates and money supply to influence inflation and economic activity</em></p>
<p>Monetary policy presents a distinct trade-off between stimulating supply and inflating prices. On one hand, lower interest rates reduce the cost of capital, which successfully encourages developers to build more homes.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Monetary policy… increases housing rents and purchase prices while fostering growth in the housing construction sector… The boost in housing construction can be explained by the lower interest rates, which alleviate the interest burden and decrease the opportunity costs for investors. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">(Kholodilin, 2025, p. 19)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this liquidity often flows into speculation rather than productive output. While construction may rise, the “cheap money” simultaneously inflates asset prices, often cancelling out affordability gains and creating instability.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The impact of money supply expansion has stimulated the property sector, but only in the short-term, with little impact on prices… Loose monetary conditions can lead to a surge in real estate lending and a housing price bubble. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_2023">(Zhao &amp; Liu, 2023, p. 6)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, while useful for short-term stimulation, relying on monetary policy risks decoupling housing prices from economic fundamentals.</p>

Given that some studies consider effect of several policies (e.g., social housing and housing allowances), the sum of these numbers exceeds the total number of studies examined here. The length of each bar reflects the relative attention devoted by researchers to the corresponding pair policy-effect as measured by the number of studies that investigate it.

<p><strong>A Vision for Housing in America</strong></p>
<p>The founding fathers understood that political liberty depends on material independence. A self-governing people cannot exist where most families are economically captive and priced out of stable homes, forever dependent on landlords, or forced to treat shelter as a speculative gamble rather than a foundation for life.</p>
<p>In 1776, Adams warned that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The only possible Way then of preserving the Ballance of Power on the side of equal Liberty and public Virtue, is to make the Acquisition of Land easy to every Member of Society. <br> John Adams (1776)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In early America, land was the primary source of independence. Today, housing plays that same role. When access to housing is broad, secure, and attainable, families gain stability, workers gain mobility, and communities gain the confidence to say “yes” to the future</p>
<p>That moral intuition did not fade with the Founding generation. A century later, John F. Kennedy captured the same truth in modern terms:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The right to a good home is one of the noblest motives in the American way of life – it is inherent in the heart and soul of every American and should be the cornerstone of all public policy.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Today, a property owner’s right to build is held hostage by arbitrary local bureaucracies and NIMBY obstructionism.

<p>We will modernize building codes to allow single-stair buildings up to 6–8 stories, adopting safe European and Seattle-based standards.

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Even if we could build, it costs too much. We are strangled by red tape, outdated labor monopolies, and protectionist trade wars that make a 2x4 piece of lumber a luxury good. We are essentially making it illegal to build efficiently.</p>

<p><em>Financial &amp; Tax Reform</em></p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: This is the hard truth no one wants to say: Housing cannot be both affordable for the buyer and a high-yield investment for the seller. Current tax code bribes Americans to become “Homevoters”—people who vote against new housing to protect their asset values. This addiction to appreciation is destroying our economy.</p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To increase housing supply by disincentivizing the holding of residential property as a vacant investment vehicle, utilizing existing regulatory definitions to minimize administrative overhead.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Definitions &amp; Standards</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principal Residence (Owner-Occupied)</strong>: A property is deemed “Occupied” if it currently qualifies for the <em>Homestead Exemption</em> (or local equivalent Principal Residence Exemption) under the [State/County] Revenue &amp; Taxation Code.</p>
<p><strong>Tenanted Occupancy (Non-Owner)</strong>: For properties not claiming a Homestead Exemption, “Occupancy” requires the unit be leased to a “Permitted Occupant” for at least <strong>180 days</strong> of the tax year. * <strong>Arm’s Length Requirement:</strong> The lease must be for <strong>Fair Market Rent</strong> (as defined by HUD SAFMR, see Section 6.C) to a tenant who is not a “Related Person” as defined by <strong>26 U.S. Code § 267</strong>. * <strong>Exclusion:</strong> Short-term rentals (periods of &lt;30 consecutive days) regulated under [Local Transient Occupancy Tax Statutes] do not count toward the 180-day threshold. * <strong>De Facto Vacancy</strong>: Any property that does not meet the definition of Principal Residence or Tenanted Occupancy, and has not filed a valid Exemption, is classified as Vacant.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Tax Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>The tax is levied on the property’s current Assessed Value (AV) on a progressive scale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year 1 Vacant:</strong> 1% of AV</li>
<li><strong>Year 2 Vacant:</strong> 2% of AV</li>
<li><strong>Year 3+ Vacant:</strong> 3% of AV</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Property Attachment &amp; Transfer Rules</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Non-Arm’s Length Transfers</strong>: Transfers between parties defined as “Related Persons” by the IRS (including spouses, lineal descendants, fiduciaries, and controlled corporations) do <strong>not</strong> reset the tax rate. (e.g.&nbsp;A transfer from an individual to their own LLC retains the Year 3 (3%) tax rate)</p>
<p><strong>Arm’s Length Sales</strong>: Transfers to an unrelated party reset the tax rate. * <strong>Grace Period:</strong> The property is exempt for <strong>12 months</strong> following the recording date of the deed. * <strong>Reset Provision:</strong> If the property remains vacant after the 12-month grace period, the tax clock starts at <strong>Year 1 (1%)</strong>.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Administration &amp; Auditing</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mandatory Annual Declaration</strong>: Owners not currently claiming a Homestead Exemption must file an annual Occupancy Status Declaration. Failure to file results in automatic classification as “De Facto Vacant.”</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Based Auditing (Utility Benchmarking)</strong>: Instead of arbitrary usage numbers, the City applies a “Low Usage Flag” based on peer data. * <strong>Threshold:</strong> Average monthly consumption falling below the <strong>10th percentile</strong> of similarly sized units (bedroom count/sq ft) in the service area. * <strong>Verification:</strong> Properties flagged for low usage receive a physical confirmation code via mail. Failure to input the code online within 14 days is prima facie evidence of vacancy.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Exemptions</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Exemptions must be claimed during the declaration phase and are strictly tied to external validations.</em></p>
<p><strong>Active Renovation by Capital Expenditure Threshold</strong>: Valid for a maximum of one year per owner. To prevent minor or cosmetic work from justifying vacancy, the owner must prove substantial financial investment in the property.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Monetary Threshold:</strong> The owner must provide evidence of capital improvements totaling at least <strong>$50,000 OR 15% of the structure’s Assessed Value</strong> (whichever is lower) incurred during the tax year.</li>
<li><strong>Qualifying Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard Costs Only:</strong> Only materials and third-party labor count toward the threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> “Sweat equity” (owner’s own labor), furniture, window treatments, and easily reversible changes (e.g., removing fixtures without replacement) are explicitly excluded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permit Valuation:</strong> The “Valuation of Work” listed on the issued building permit serves as prima facie evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> If the permit value is below the threshold, the owner must submit paid invoices and receipts from licensed contractors or suppliers to bridge the gap.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Active Rental Listing (“Good Faith Effort”)</strong>: Valid for a maximum of 12 months. The property is actively listed for rent on a recognized public platform. * <strong>Rent Cap:</strong> To qualify as a “good faith” listing, the asking rent must not exceed <strong>120% of the HUD Small Area Fair Market Rent (SAFMR)</strong> for the property’s specific ZIP Code and unit size.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Confinement</strong>: The owner provides a signed attestation from a medical professional that the owner has been admitted to a facility for <strong>“Skilled Nursing Care”</strong> or <strong>“Long-Term Care”</strong> (as defined by [State] Dept of Health or CMS).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Transfer Restrictions</strong>: Occupancy or sale is prohibited by an active court order (e.g., lis pendens, probate freezes, or foreclosure redemption periods).</p>

<h1>“A well-regulated Militia…”</h1>
<p>One core of the interpretative divide seems to lie in defining a “Militia.” Is it a social construct or a governmental entity? Some may hastily assume that ‘we, the people’ collectively form the Militia.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> However, the historical and constitutional evidence suggests otherwise. The Militia is and has always been a group of armed individuals appointed by Congress and organized at the state level.</p>
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-well-regulated-militia">
EVIDENCE:
</h3>
<p>If the Constitution’s framers intended the Militia to be the “yeomanry” and anyone who desired a free State, we would expect the Constitution to echo this sentiment. The Constitution, however, addresses the Militia explicitly as an apparatus under the State and Federal government.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 8; The Constitution of the United States of America states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[The Congress shall have Power] To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="madison1791"><em><span>U.S. Constitution</span></em> (1791)</span></strong></p>

<p>Rhode Island — May 29, 1790 - Rhode Island requests that twenty-one alterations be made to it.</p>
<p>The debate over the Second Amendment didn’t happen in a single room on a single day. It was a four-year process that evolved from state-level protests to federal law.</p>
<p>During the battle on whether or not to ratify the Constitution, “Anti-Federalists” refused to support it without a Bill of Rights, fearing the new federal government will disarm the people to impose tyranny.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pennsylvania Dissent of the Minority</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On Dec 12, 1787, Pennsylvania becomes the second state to vote in support of the Constitution. In response, the Anti-Federalists publish a furious dissent demanding several amendments including one for protecting the right to bear arms individually:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Seventh. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: and that the military shall be kept under strict subordination to and be governed by the civil powers. <sup>3</sup> <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="bryan_1787">Minority of the Convention of the State of Pennsylvania (1787)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rejection of these amendments showed that the founders understood the difference between the private individual right of gun ownership and the collective right to bear arms under a state militia. It is telling that the founding fathers voted against this proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Massachusetts Compromise and the Adams Amendment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In early 1788, the ratification of the Constitution was in peril as Massachusetts was the first state where Anti-Federalists had a potential majority. To ensure a vote in favor of the Constitution, leading Federalists worked with Anti-Federalist John Hancock to propose a “Conciliatory Proposition” in which Hancock would propose nine amendments to be passed immediately after the ratification of the Constitution.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 6, 1788, during the final hours of the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, Samuel Adams attempted to introduce various amendments to the Constitution, including one that would have explicitly guaranteed the individual right of citizens to own firearms.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And that the said Constitution be never construed… to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.”” <br> <strong>Samuel Adams in <span class="citation" data-cites="adams_1856">Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1856)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the Founding Fathers present in Massachusetts explicitly voted “No” on adding this specific protection of individual gun ownership to their ratification terms. Probably, the main reason why is that it “was judged hazardous to hamper the main issue with further conditions” <span class="citation" data-cites="wells_1865">Wells (1865)</span>,</p>
<p>While this rejection was largely political, it at least confirms that the founding fathers in Massachusetts understood there was a difference between the individual and private right for peaceable citizens to keep their own arms, and the collective right to bear arms for the militia.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Hampshire’s Proposed Amendment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>New Hampshire was the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, which made the document legally binding. However, like many states, New Hampshire ratified it on the condition or strong recommendation that a Bill of Rights be added immediately after.</p>
<p>The convention in New Hampshire submitted a list of twelve proposed amendments to the First Congress alongside their ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the twelfth being:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Twelfth, Congress shall never disarm any Citizen unless such as are or have been in Actual Rebellion.” <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="langdon_1788">New Hampshire Ratifying Convention (1788)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal, including hundreds of others from each state convention, were sent to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p><strong>Debates over the Bill of Rights</strong></p>
<p>Once the constitution was officially ratified, Madison’s task in the First Congress in New York was to filter over 200 state proposals into a cohesive Bill of Rights. He aimed to satisfy Anti-Federalist demands for liberty without sacrificing federal stability.</p>
<p>When Madison was writing his draft for the second amendment, he chose not to use the language from the New Hampshire proposal (“Never disarm any citizen”) and instead looked to his own state, Virginia, which had proposed language focusing on the “Militia” and the “security of a free state.” The first proposed draft of the second amendment was as so:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.” <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="madison_1789">Madison (1789)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were seven major changes occurred to the original draft before the current text of the amendment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of the “well-armed” description of the militia</strong>: Since this debate of this removal is not recorded, we can only guess about the resons of its removal. It is possible that they voted this down to make sure the amendment did not imply that the federal government had an obligation to supply the weapons to the militias of the states.
<ul>
<li>Anti-Federalists Elbridge Gerry proposed to add <strong>“trained to arms”</strong> after a well regulated militia as “it would become the duty of the Government to provide this security, and furnish a greater certainty of its being done.” however, as “Mr.&nbsp;Gerry’s motion not being seconded”, the motion died.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Removal of the Conscientious Objector clause</strong>: The clause stating that “no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person” was deleted in the Senate. Even though this wording passed in the House, we can discover the thought of why this clause was contested. In all of these cases, all support and controversy was under the assumption that the second amendment is in regards to service of a formal militia. <span class="citation" data-cites="lloyd_1789">United States House of Representatives (1987)</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fear of Government Manipulation</strong>: Elbridge Gerry argued that this clause was dangerous because the government could arbitrarily declare large groups of people “religiously scrupulous” to prevent them from bearing arms. He feared this would destroy the militia, giving the government an excuse to establish a “standing army” (which he viewed as a threat to liberty).</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Unfairness</strong>: James Jackson argued it was unjust for some citizens to defend the country while others did nothing. He proposed that those who refused to fight due to religion should have to pay an “equivalent” (a fee) to support the defense.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of a Declining Religion</strong>: Thomas Scott worried that if religion declined in the future, people with no religion would pretend to be scrupulous just to avoid military service. He argued this would result in a militia that “can never be depended upon.”</li>
<li><strong>Defense of the Clause</strong>: Elias Boudinot argued in favor of keeping the protection. He believed the government should respect the consciences of its citizens and noted that forcing pacifists to fight was useless anyway, as they would “rather die than use [arms].”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Removal of the phrase “composed of the body of the people” for defining the militia</strong>: Though this phrase was in the original drafts for the second amendment, the Senate voted explicitly to remove this from the wording of the amendment. One reason this could be is that if the Second Amendment constitutionally defined the militia as “the body of the people” (everyone), it would force Congress to organize all people which would not be feasible. Much to the dismay of the Anti-Federalists, the wording remained parital towards the Federalist agenda by keeping the idea of a select militia without violating the Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>Removal of the description of the militia as “being the best security of a free country”</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Denial of the propsed addition to change “bear arms” to “bear arms for the common defense”</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Denial of the proposed addition to ban standing armies in peacetime</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Aedanus Burke proposed to add a change, stating: “<strong>A standing army of regular troops in time of peace is dangerous to public liberty, and such shall not be raised or kept up in time of peace but from necessity, and for the security of the people, nor then without the consent of two-thirds of the members present of both Houses; and in all cases the military shall be subordinate to the civil authority</strong>. Burke, however, saw”apparent disposition of the committee” and reluctantly recalled his proposal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Denial of the proposed addition to add a clause to say that the military would be “under strict subordination to the civil power”</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<h1>“being necessary to the security of a free State”</h1>
<p>Some critics might question, “If the framers were concerned about the potential for government tyranny, why would they enshrine protections for the same government?” This argument needs to be clarified since anyone who has taken an introductory civics class should have heard of the concept of checks and balances. After all, the foundational idea behind the American experiment was to see if different branches or segments of the government could effectively regulate each other.</p>
<p>In Federalist No.&nbsp;46, James Madison directly addresses the federal overreach of power. He imagines a hypothetical situation where the federal government steps outside its constitutional bounds. In such a scenario, Madison theorizes that the state Militias would stand with their local government. This makes sense. If the federal government were to impose its oppressive will over the people, a grass-roots militia probably wouldn’t cut it- even if they were to have machine guns.</p>
<p>If the Militias of the States were going to be a reasonable alternative to the military, the founders wished it to be robust enough. Hamilton writes, “If a well-regulated militia is the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of national security.”</p>
<p>In this instance, “well-regulated” refers to the capabilities of the Militia. Hamilton acknowledges that if the people were the Militia, there could be no feasible way to discipline them to be competent militiamen. Such a task seemed so implausible that in comparison to a well-trained Militia, Hamilton states that:</p>
<p>The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution…. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year. But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia… it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it. - Federalist Paper No.&nbsp;29</p>
<p>To defend the security of a free state, we would need a well-trained and well-disciplined Militia. Hamilton explains that this is not, nor could be, the people at large.</p>
<p>The crux of the interpretative divide seems to lie in defining a “Militia.” Is it a social construct or a governmental entity? Some may hastily assume that ‘we, the people’ collectively form the Militia. However, the historical and constitutional evidence suggests otherwise. The Militia is and has always been a group of armed individuals appointed by Congress and organized at the state level.</p>
<p>If the Constitution’s framers intended the Militia to be a personal construct, we expect the Constitution to echo this sentiment. Yet, the Constitution addresses the Militia as a governmental entity.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[The Congress shall have Power] To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress… (Article I, Section 8) <span class="citation" data-cites="usconst">(<strong>usconst?</strong>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As demonstrated in these quotes, the framers explicitly advocated for the governmental establishment and regulation of Militias, with each state authorized and encouraged to organize its own.</p>
<p>Some critics might question, “If the framers were concerned about the potential for government tyranny, why would they enshrine protections for the same government?” This argument needs to be clarified since anyone who has taken an introductory civics class should have heard of the concept of checks and balances. After all, the foundational idea behind the American experiment was to see if different branches or segments of the government could effectively regulate each other.</p>
<p>In <em>Federalist No.&nbsp;46</em>, James Madison directly addresses the federal overreach of power. He imagines a hypothetical situation where the federal government steps outside its constitutional bounds. In such a scenario, Madison theorizes that the state Militias would stand with their local government <span class="citation" data-cites="madison1788">(<strong>madison1788?</strong>)</span>.

</section>
<section id="the-right-of-the-people-to-keep" class="level1">
<h1>“The right of the people to keep…”</h1>
<p>While the “Militia” is clearly a governmental entity, we must grapple with the second half of the text: “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms.”</p>
<p>The term “people” within the Constitution appears to have a level of ambiguity. The “People” who ordained and established the Constitution were the delegates of the Constitutional Convention and state representatives—not necessarily the broader public.</p>
<p>However, when we specifically analyze the right to <strong>“keep”</strong> arms, the historical record pivots away from the collective and toward the individual. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the Second Amendment codified a “pre-existing right” inherited from English law. That inheritance comes directly from the <strong>English Bill of Rights of 1689</strong>, which guaranteed: <em>“That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="engbill1689">(<strong>engbill1689?</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>Crucially, this protection was explicitly framed around <strong>“defence”</strong>—a personal necessity.</p>
<p>This aligns with the most influential legal commentator of the era, Sir William Blackstone. In his <em>Commentaries</em>, Blackstone described self-defense as “the primary law of nature” <span class="citation" data-cites="blackstone1765">(<strong>blackstone1765?</strong>)</span>. This natural right was linked to the <strong>“Castle Doctrine”</strong>—the principle that a man’s home is his sanctuary. If the right to defense in the home was the “primary law of nature,” then the right to <strong>“keep”</strong> the tools of that defense (arms) in the home was a necessary prerequisite.</p>
<p>We see this confirmed in the state constitutions written by the same generation of Founders. The Pennsylvania (1776) and Vermont (1777) constitutions explicitly protected the people’s right to bear arms “for the defence of <strong>themselves</strong> and the State” <span class="citation" data-cites="paconst1776">(<strong>paconst1776?</strong>)</span>. The inclusion of “themselves” is the smoking gun: it proves that the legal concept of arms ownership extended to the private defense of the individual.</p>
</section>
<section id="and-bear-arms" class="level1">
<h1>“…and bear Arms”</h1>
<p>While the right to <strong>“keep”</strong> arms appears individual and home-centric, the right to <strong>“bear”</strong> arms returns us to the collective, military context established by the Militia clause.</p>
<p>Advancements in data analysis offer new ways to interpret the original intent of the framers. One such method is <strong>corpus linguistics</strong>, an approach employed by Woods (2020) to scrutinize the phrase “the right of the people” and “bear arms” within the context of American English at the time.</p>
<p>Woods analyzed 153 occurrences of “the right of the people” within the <em>Corpus of Founding Era American English</em> (COFEA). He discovered that the vast majority of these instances were used in the context of collective rights (such as “to assemble” or “choose their own rulers”) rather than individual liberties <span class="citation" data-cites="woods2020">(<strong>woods2020?</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>More importantly, Woods scrutinized the terms “to keep and bear” within the COFEA. He identified every instance where the word ‘arm’ or ‘arms’ appeared within four words of any form of the verb ‘bear.’ A random sample of 300 such instances yielded the following breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instances of <em>bear arms</em> in an ambiguous context occurred about 2% of the time.</li>
<li>Direct quotation of the Second Amendment occurred less than 1% of the time.</li>
<li>Non-militia/private usage context occurred about 4% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Militia/Military context accounts for the remaining 93%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Even the word “arms” has a collective, military connotation. Baron (2019) performed a similar analysis and found that “bear arms” was overwhelmingly a military idiom. Baron states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A search of Brigham Young University’s new online Corpus… shows 1,572 instances of the phrase… and only a handful don’t refer to war, soldiering or organized, armed action. These databases confirm that the natural meaning of “bear arms” in the framers’ day was military <span class="citation" data-cites="baron2019">(<strong>baron2019?</strong>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This linguistic evidence is reinforced by the <strong>Statute of Northampton</strong>, an English law remaining in force during the Founding era that banned men from going “armed by night nor by day” in fairs or markets <span class="citation" data-cites="northampton1328">(<strong>northampton1328?</strong>)</span>. While the home (Keep) was a sanctuary, the public square (Bear) was a regulated space where the carrying of weapons was restricted to preserve the peace.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-the-third-way" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion: The Third Way</h1>
<p>Careful examination of the Second Amendment reveals that its true essence is not a simple binary.</p>
<p>The language and context of the Constitution, supported by historical evidence and data-driven analysis, suggest a <strong>bifurcated</strong> interpretation. The Founders, including Madison and Hamilton, perceived the “well-regulated Militia” as a government-regulated body, and the “bearing” of arms as a civic, military duty. This supports the collective interpretation of the Amendment regarding public carry and military service.</p>
<p>However, the “keeping” of arms was grounded in the “Castle Doctrine” and the natural right to self-defense, as evidenced by Blackstone and early state constitutions.</p>
<p>Thus, our understanding of the Second Amendment must shift from a winner-take-all debate to a nuanced “Castle and Citadel” model: safeguarding the individual right to possess arms in the home, while recognizing the state’s historical authority to regulate the “bearing” of arms in the public sphere.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It was never 30 years,” said Richard Zilka, a 40-year veteran of the appliance service industry who runs a local repair business near Miami. Even the more straightforward appliances made three or four decades ago lasted only 10 to 15 years, said Zilka. “That was the average lifespan,” he said. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="wharton2024">Wharton (2024a)</span></p>

<h3 class="anchored">
EVIDENCE:
</h3>
<p><strong>The article “Long-term lifetime trends of large appliances since the introduction in Norwegian households” (published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2025), analyzed historical data on six types of large household appliances (fridges, freezers, washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, and ovens) in Norway. Contrary to popular belief, the researchers found that product lifetimes are not universally decreasing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For most appliances (fridges, freezers, dishwashers, dryers), the average lifespan has remained stable over the decades.</li>
<li>Two appliances showed a significant drop in lifespan: washing machines (dropped ~45%) and ovens (dropped ~39%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did Washing Machines and Ovens decline? Since the study dismisses “planned obsolescence” as the primary cause, it offers alternative explanations for the two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Washing Machines: The decline in years is likely due to increased usage intensity. Households wash clothes much more frequently today than in the past. While the machine lasts fewer years, it might still be delivering a similar number of wash cycles before wearing out.</li>
<li>Ovens: The decline is largely social, not technical. A high percentage (~40%) of ovens are discarded while still functioning, often due to kitchen renovations. As the kitchen became a social hub, consumers began replacing ovens for aesthetic reasons rather than mechanical failure.</li>

<p><strong>The EIA RECS report measures only a ~3 percent decrease in old refrigerators from 2020 compared to 30 years prior in 1990.</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) earliest records with granular appliance age data, reported that 8.4% of households had a primary refrigerator over 20 years old, with 38.2% exceeding 10 years. By the 2020 RECS, these figures were 5.5% and 35.1%, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers trade group shows that in 2010 most appliances lasted from 11 to 16 years. By 2019, those numbers had dropped, to a range of nine to 14 years. (In some cases, such as for gas ranges and dryers, the lifespans actually increased)</strong></p>
