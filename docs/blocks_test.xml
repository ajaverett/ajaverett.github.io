<p>Debate help for later:</p>
<section id="restrictive-rental-housing-policies" class="level1">
<h1>Restrictive Rental Housing Policies</h1>
<p>(Government stops rent from going up and keep people in their homes)</p>
<section id="rent-control" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rent-control">Rent Control</h2>
<p>(Government puts a cap on how much landlords can charge or how much they can raise the rent)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The most prominent effects of rent control are decline of rents for controlled dwellings, reduced residential mobility, lower construction, lower quality of housing, higher rents for uncontrolled dwellings, and lower property prices. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2024">(Kholodilin, 2024, p. 14)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<section id="section" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="section"></h3>
<p>WIP</p>
<p>Rent control works for the people currently living there—their rent stays low. But, it discourages builders from building new apartments (because they won’t make as much money) and landlords stop fixing things (because they can’t raise rents to cover costs), so the quality of housing drops. Ironically, rents for uncontrolled apartments often skyrocket because there are fewer places to live.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="eviction-protection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eviction-protection">Eviction Protection</h2>
<p>(Government regulates how landlords can remove a tenant.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By far the largest group of studies of eviction protection finds eviction-reducing effect. However, the number of studies on protection of tenants from evictions is very small. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">Kholodilin (2025)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fewer people get evicted. Tenants stay in their homes longer and have more stability.</p>
</section>
<section id="housing-rationing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-rationing">Housing Rationing</h2>
<p>(Government stops people from using homes for short-term vacation rentals or limits who can move to a city. e.g.&nbsp;Airbnb Bans)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Likewise, the number of studies on housing rationing is small. They find a negative effect on property prices. Most of these studies refer to the recent policies prohibiting or restricting shortterm rentals on platforms like Airbnb, as authorities suspect that these remove dwellings from the long-term rental housing market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Housing rationing lowers property values. You might expect it to free up homes for locals, but the data mostly shows it just makes the homes worth less money.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="housing-subsidies" class="level1">
<h1>Housing Subsidies</h1>
<p>(Give people money or tax breaks so they can afford a home.)</p>
<section id="housing-allowances" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-allowances">Housing Allowances</h2>
<p>(Government gives low-income families cash or vouchers to help pay rent. e.g.&nbsp;Vouchers)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The numbers of studies that find positive and negative effects [on employment] are comparable, while the largest group of studies did not find any statistically significant effects… This reflects the complex interplay of incentives. On the one hand… housing benefits could diminish incentives to work [because] housing allowances are reduced proportionally with earnings… [but on] the other hand, the subsidies could encourage employment because they increase stability, allowing [recipients] to allocate more resources toward expenses related to employment… <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="kholodilin_2025">Kholodilin (2025)</span></p>

</section>
<section id="social-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-housing">Social Housing</h2>
<p>(Government builds and runs apartments for low-income people. e.g.&nbsp;Public Housing)</p>
<p>Social housing policies lower the rent burden for the people who get in. However, the study found a “employment reduction” effect—meaning people living there are less likely to work, possibly because they risk losing their subsidized apartment if they earn too much money</p>
</section>
<section id="mortgage-interest-deduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mortgage-interest-deduction">Mortgage Interest Deduction</h2>
<p>(Government lets homeowners subtract the interest they pay on their mortgage from their taxes)</p>
<p>Mortgage interest deductions fail at its main goal: it doesn’t actually increase the number of people who own homes. Instead, it just encourages people to buy bigger, more expensive houses, which drives up home prices for everyone.</p>
</section>
<section id="homeownership-subsidies" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homeownership-subsidies">Homeownership Subsidies</h2>
<p>(Government offers direct cash or help to buy a home) Homeownership subsidies increase home prices (sellers know buyers have more cash) and creates “urban sprawl” (cities spreading out further and further).</p>

<section id="quality-environment-policies" class="level1">
<h1>Quality &amp; Environment Policies</h1>
<section id="building-codes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-codes">Building Codes</h2>
<p>(Government regulates how thick walls must be, how safe wiring must be, and how energy-efficient the home must be)</p>
<p>Homes definitely use less electricity and are safer. However, these rules make building expensive, so the final price of the house goes up</p>
</section>
<section id="land-use-regulations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="land-use-regulations">Land Use Regulations</h2>
<p>(Government implements zoning)</p>
<p>Land use regulations like zoning make neighborhoods “nicer” (less crowded, more consistent look), but it severely limits the number of new homes. Because supply is choked off, housing prices go up significantly</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="taxes" class="level1">
<h1>Taxes</h1>
<section id="transfer-taxes-stamp-duty" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transfer-taxes-stamp-duty">Transfer Taxes (Stamp Duty)</h2>
<p>(Governments mandate a fee when you buy or sell a house)</p>
<p>People move less often because it costs too much to sell and buy a new place. It slows down the whole housing market</p>
</section>
<section id="property-tax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="property-tax">Property Tax</h2>
<p>(Government taxes houses annually based on how much your home is worth)</p>
<p>Property tax generally lowers home prices (because the tax makes owning the home more expensive month-to-month) and discourages new construction.</p>
</section>
<section id="vacancy-tax" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vacancy-tax">Vacancy Tax</h2>
<p>(Government taxes homes that are sitting empty)</p>
<p>This actually increases construction. It pushes owners to either rent out the empty space or sell it to someone who will use it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="government-spending">Government Spending</h2>
<p>(Government spends a lot of money on public projects)</p>
<p>It drives up prices (inflation), and because the government is using up resources and borrowing power, it actually makes it harder/more expensive for private companies to build homes (a “negative” effect on construction)</p>

  <title>Understanding the second amendment?</title>

<p>“A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="madison1791"><em><span>U.S. Constitution</span></em> (1791)</span></strong></p>

<section id="a-well-regulated-militia" class="level1">
<h1>“A well-regulated Militia…”</h1>
<p>One core of the interpretative divide seems to lie in defining a “Militia.” Is it a social construct or a governmental entity? Some may hastily assume that ‘we, the people’ collectively form the Militia.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> However, the historical and constitutional evidence suggests otherwise. The Militia is and has always been a group of armed individuals appointed by Congress and organized at the state level.</p>
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-well-regulated-militia">
EVIDENCE:
</h3>
<p>If the Constitution’s framers intended the Militia to be the “yeomanry” and anyone who desired a free State, we would expect the Constitution to echo this sentiment. The Constitution, however, addresses the Militia explicitly as an apparatus under the State and Federal government.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 8; The Constitution of the United States of America states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[The Congress shall have Power] To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="madison1791"><em><span>U.S. Constitution</span></em> (1791)</span></strong></p>

<p>Rhode Island — May 29, 1790 - Rhode Island requests that twenty-one alterations be made to it.</p>
<p>The debate over the Second Amendment didn’t happen in a single room on a single day. It was a four-year process that evolved from state-level protests to federal law.</p>
<p>During the battle on whether or not to ratify the Constitution, “Anti-Federalists” refused to support it without a Bill of Rights, fearing the new federal government will disarm the people to impose tyranny.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pennsylvania Dissent of the Minority</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On Dec 12, 1787, Pennsylvania becomes the second state to vote in support of the Constitution. In response, the Anti-Federalists publish a furious dissent demanding several amendments including one for protecting the right to bear arms individually:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Seventh. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: and that the military shall be kept under strict subordination to and be governed by the civil powers. <sup>3</sup> <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="bryan_1787">Minority of the Convention of the State of Pennsylvania (1787)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rejection of these amendments showed that the founders understood the difference between the private individual right of gun ownership and the collective right to bear arms under a state militia. It is telling that the founding fathers voted against this proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Massachusetts Compromise and the Adams Amendment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In early 1788, the ratification of the Constitution was in peril as Massachusetts was the first state where Anti-Federalists had a potential majority. To ensure a vote in favor of the Constitution, leading Federalists worked with Anti-Federalist John Hancock to propose a “Conciliatory Proposition” in which Hancock would propose nine amendments to be passed immediately after the ratification of the Constitution.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 6, 1788, during the final hours of the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, Samuel Adams attempted to introduce various amendments to the Constitution, including one that would have explicitly guaranteed the individual right of citizens to own firearms.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“And that the said Constitution be never construed… to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.”” <br> <strong>Samuel Adams in <span class="citation" data-cites="adams_1856">Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1856)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the Founding Fathers present in Massachusetts explicitly voted “No” on adding this specific protection of individual gun ownership to their ratification terms. Probably, the main reason why is that it “was judged hazardous to hamper the main issue with further conditions” <span class="citation" data-cites="wells_1865">Wells (1865)</span>,</p>
<p>While this rejection was largely political, it at least confirms that the founding fathers in Massachusetts understood there was a difference between the individual and private right for peaceable citizens to keep their own arms, and the collective right to bear arms for the militia.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Hampshire’s Proposed Amendment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>New Hampshire was the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, which made the document legally binding. However, like many states, New Hampshire ratified it on the condition or strong recommendation that a Bill of Rights be added immediately after.</p>
<p>The convention in New Hampshire submitted a list of twelve proposed amendments to the First Congress alongside their ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the twelfth being:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Twelfth, Congress shall never disarm any Citizen unless such as are or have been in Actual Rebellion.” <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="langdon_1788">New Hampshire Ratifying Convention (1788)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal, including hundreds of others from each state convention, were sent to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p><strong>Debates over the Bill of Rights</strong></p>
<p>Once the constitution was officially ratified, Madison’s task in the First Congress in New York was to filter over 200 state proposals into a cohesive Bill of Rights. He aimed to satisfy Anti-Federalist demands for liberty without sacrificing federal stability.</p>
<p>When Madison was writing his draft for the second amendment, he chose not to use the language from the New Hampshire proposal (“Never disarm any citizen”) and instead looked to his own state, Virginia, which had proposed language focusing on the “Militia” and the “security of a free state.” The first proposed draft of the second amendment was as so:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.” <br> <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="madison_1789">Madison (1789)</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were seven major changes occurred to the original draft before the current text of the amendment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of the “well-armed” description of the militia</strong>: Since this debate of this removal is not recorded, we can only guess about the resons of its removal. It is possible that they voted this down to make sure the amendment did not imply that the federal government had an obligation to supply the weapons to the militias of the states.
<ul>
<li>Anti-Federalists Elbridge Gerry proposed to add <strong>“trained to arms”</strong> after a well regulated militia as “it would become the duty of the Government to provide this security, and furnish a greater certainty of its being done.” however, as “Mr.&nbsp;Gerry’s motion not being seconded”, the motion died.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Removal of the Conscientious Objector clause</strong>: The clause stating that “no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person” was deleted in the Senate. Even though this wording passed in the House, we can discover the thought of why this clause was contested. In all of these cases, all support and controversy was under the assumption that the second amendment is in regards to service of a formal militia. <span class="citation" data-cites="lloyd_1789">United States House of Representatives (1987)</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fear of Government Manipulation</strong>: Elbridge Gerry argued that this clause was dangerous because the government could arbitrarily declare large groups of people “religiously scrupulous” to prevent them from bearing arms. He feared this would destroy the militia, giving the government an excuse to establish a “standing army” (which he viewed as a threat to liberty).</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Unfairness</strong>: James Jackson argued it was unjust for some citizens to defend the country while others did nothing. He proposed that those who refused to fight due to religion should have to pay an “equivalent” (a fee) to support the defense.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of a Declining Religion</strong>: Thomas Scott worried that if religion declined in the future, people with no religion would pretend to be scrupulous just to avoid military service. He argued this would result in a militia that “can never be depended upon.”</li>
<li><strong>Defense of the Clause</strong>: Elias Boudinot argued in favor of keeping the protection. He believed the government should respect the consciences of its citizens and noted that forcing pacifists to fight was useless anyway, as they would “rather die than use [arms].”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Removal of the phrase “composed of the body of the people” for defining the militia</strong>: Though this phrase was in the original drafts for the second amendment, the Senate voted explicitly to remove this from the wording of the amendment. One reason this could be is that if the Second Amendment constitutionally defined the militia as “the body of the people” (everyone), it would force Congress to organize all people which would not be feasible. Much to the dismay of the Anti-Federalists, the wording remained parital towards the Federalist agenda by keeping the idea of a select militia without violating the Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>Removal of the description of the militia as “being the best security of a free country”</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Denial of the propsed addition to change “bear arms” to “bear arms for the common defense”</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Denial of the proposed addition to ban standing armies in peacetime</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Aedanus Burke proposed to add a change, stating: “<strong>A standing army of regular troops in time of peace is dangerous to public liberty, and such shall not be raised or kept up in time of peace but from necessity, and for the security of the people, nor then without the consent of two-thirds of the members present of both Houses; and in all cases the military shall be subordinate to the civil authority</strong>. Burke, however, saw”apparent disposition of the committee” and reluctantly recalled his proposal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Denial of the proposed addition to add a clause to say that the military would be “under strict subordination to the civil power”</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<h1>“being necessary to the security of a free State”</h1>
<p>Some critics might question, “If the framers were concerned about the potential for government tyranny, why would they enshrine protections for the same government?” This argument needs to be clarified since anyone who has taken an introductory civics class should have heard of the concept of checks and balances. After all, the foundational idea behind the American experiment was to see if different branches or segments of the government could effectively regulate each other.</p>
<p>In Federalist No.&nbsp;46, James Madison directly addresses the federal overreach of power. He imagines a hypothetical situation where the federal government steps outside its constitutional bounds. In such a scenario, Madison theorizes that the state Militias would stand with their local government. This makes sense. If the federal government were to impose its oppressive will over the people, a grass-roots militia probably wouldn’t cut it- even if they were to have machine guns.</p>
<p>If the Militias of the States were going to be a reasonable alternative to the military, the founders wished it to be robust enough. Hamilton writes, “If a well-regulated militia is the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of national security.”</p>
<p>In this instance, “well-regulated” refers to the capabilities of the Militia. Hamilton acknowledges that if the people were the Militia, there could be no feasible way to discipline them to be competent militiamen. Such a task seemed so implausible that in comparison to a well-trained Militia, Hamilton states that:</p>
<p>The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution…. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year. But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia… it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it. - Federalist Paper No.&nbsp;29</p>
<p>To defend the security of a free state, we would need a well-trained and well-disciplined Militia. Hamilton explains that this is not, nor could be, the people at large.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As demonstrated in these quotes, the framers explicitly advocated for the governmental establishment and regulation of Militias, with each state authorized and encouraged to organize its own.</p>
<p>Some critics might question, “If the framers were concerned about the potential for government tyranny, why would they enshrine protections for the same government?” This argument needs to be clarified since anyone who has taken an introductory civics class should have heard of the concept of checks and balances.

<section id="the-right-of-the-people-to-keep" class="level1">
<h1>“The right of the people to keep…”</h1>
<p>While the “Militia” is clearly a governmental entity, we must grapple with the second half of the text: “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms.”</p>
<p>The term “people” within the Constitution appears to have a level of ambiguity. The “People” who ordained and established the Constitution were the delegates of the Constitutional Convention and state representatives—not necessarily the broader public.</p>
<p>However, when we specifically analyze the right to <strong>“keep”</strong> arms, the historical record pivots away from the collective and toward the individual. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the Second Amendment codified a “pre-existing right” inherited from English law. That inheritance comes directly from the <strong>English Bill of Rights of 1689</strong>, which guaranteed: <em>“That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="engbill1689">(<strong>engbill1689?</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>Crucially, this protection was explicitly framed around <strong>“defence”</strong>—a personal necessity.</p>
<p>This aligns with the most influential legal commentator of the era, Sir William Blackstone. In his <em>Commentaries</em>, Blackstone described self-defense as “the primary law of nature” <span class="citation" data-cites="blackstone1765">(<strong>blackstone1765?</strong>)</span>. This natural right was linked to the <strong>“Castle Doctrine”</strong>—the principle that a man’s home is his sanctuary. If the right to defense in the home was the “primary law of nature,” then the right to <strong>“keep”</strong> the tools of that defense (arms) in the home was a necessary prerequisite.</p>
<p>We see this confirmed in the state constitutions written by the same generation of Founders. The Pennsylvania (1776) and Vermont (1777) constitutions explicitly protected the people’s right to bear arms “for the defence of <strong>themselves</strong> and the State” <span class="citation" data-cites="paconst1776">(<strong>paconst1776?</strong>)</span>. The inclusion of “themselves” is the smoking gun: it proves that the legal concept of arms ownership extended to the private defense of the individual.</p>

<section id="and-bear-arms" class="level1">
<h1>“…and bear Arms”</h1>
<p>While the right to <strong>“keep”</strong> arms appears individual and home-centric, the right to <strong>“bear”</strong> arms returns us to the collective, military context established by the Militia clause.</p>
<p>Advancements in data analysis offer new ways to interpret the original intent of the framers. One such method is <strong>corpus linguistics</strong>, an approach employed by Woods (2020) to scrutinize the phrase “the right of the people” and “bear arms” within the context of American English at the time.</p>
<p>Woods analyzed 153 occurrences of “the right of the people” within the <em>Corpus of Founding Era American English</em> (COFEA). He discovered that the vast majority of these instances were used in the context of collective rights (such as “to assemble” or “choose their own rulers”) rather than individual liberties <span class="citation" data-cites="woods2020">(<strong>woods2020?</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>More importantly, Woods scrutinized the terms “to keep and bear” within the COFEA. He identified every instance where the word ‘arm’ or ‘arms’ appeared within four words of any form of the verb ‘bear.’ A random sample of 300 such instances yielded the following breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instances of <em>bear arms</em> in an ambiguous context occurred about 2% of the time.</li>
<li>Direct quotation of the Second Amendment occurred less than 1% of the time.</li>
<li>Non-militia/private usage context occurred about 4% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Militia/Military context accounts for the remaining 93%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Even the word “arms” has a collective, military connotation. Baron (2019) performed a similar analysis and found that “bear arms” was overwhelmingly a military idiom. Baron states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A search of Brigham Young University’s new online Corpus… shows 1,572 instances of the phrase… and only a handful don’t refer to war, soldiering or organized, armed action. These databases confirm that the natural meaning of “bear arms” in the framers’ day was military <span class="citation" data-cites="baron2019">(<strong>baron2019?</strong>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This linguistic evidence is reinforced by the <strong>Statute of Northampton</strong>, an English law remaining in force during the Founding era that banned men from going “armed by night nor by day” in fairs or markets <span class="citation" data-cites="northampton1328">(<strong>northampton1328?</strong>)</span>. While the home (Keep) was a sanctuary, the public square (Bear) was a regulated space where the carrying of weapons was restricted to preserve the peace.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-the-third-way" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion: The Third Way</h1>
<p>Careful examination of the Second Amendment reveals that its true essence is not a simple binary.</p>
<p>The language and context of the Constitution, supported by historical evidence and data-driven analysis, suggest a <strong>bifurcated</strong> interpretation. The Founders, including Madison and Hamilton, perceived the “well-regulated Militia” as a government-regulated body, and the “bearing” of arms as a civic, military duty. This supports the collective interpretation of the Amendment regarding public carry and military service.</p>
<p>However, the “keeping” of arms was grounded in the “Castle Doctrine” and the natural right to self-defense, as evidenced by Blackstone and early state constitutions.</p>
<p>Thus, our understanding of the Second Amendment must shift from a winner-take-all debate to a nuanced “Castle and Citadel” model: safeguarding the individual right to possess arms in the home, while recognizing the state’s historical authority to regulate the “bearing” of arms in the public sphere.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Ironically, the “We” in “We the People” could not refer to all the people of the United States, as those who <em>established</em> the Constitution were merely 39 deputies in Philadelphia from the various States, and those who <em>ordained</em> it were the roughly 1,000 delegates elected to special state Ratifying Conventions from the various States. The people in this case could not be the general population.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I often see George Mason, one of the strongest critics of the constitution, quoted to define the militia as “the whole people” <span class="citation" data-cites="elliot_1788b">Elliot (1987)</span>. It is extremely obvious that Mason understood that the militia was some organized aparatus under the respective states in his arguments against the Constitution. <span class="citation" data-cites="elliot_1788a">Elliot (1788)</span> For example, under the Constitution, he worried about<br><br> • “<strong>double sets of regimentals</strong>” (something that could only be a worry if the state militia is regimented)<br> • “<strong>neglect</strong>” from the government in arming the people (something that could only be a worry if the militia is disciplined by the government)<br> • “<strong>martial law of the militia when not on duty</strong>” (I am pretty sure he is not worried that the US Government is the one giving martial law to literally all people)<br> • “<strong>concurrent power</strong>” from the United States Congress and the various States (which could only be a worry if the United States Congress and State governments have concurrent power over the militia) <br><br> The rhetorical point Mason is making in his debate is specifically against the Constitution’s wording in which the militia of the future could exclude the higher classes as opposed to the current composition of the militia which contains the “whole people”. The full quote for context is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I ask, Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers. But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day. If that paper [The US Constitution] on the table gets no alteration, the militia of the future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor; but they may be confined to the lower and middle classes of the people, granting exclusion to the higher classes of the people.</p>

  <title>Planned Obsolecence in Home Appliances</title>

<p>“It was never 30 years,” said Richard Zilka, a 40-year veteran of the appliance service industry who runs a local repair business near Miami. Even the more straightforward appliances made three or four decades ago lasted only 10 to 15 years, said Zilka. “That was the average lifespan,” he said. <br> <span class="citation" data-cites="wharton2024">Wharton (2024a)</span></p>

<p><strong>The article “Long-term lifetime trends of large appliances since the introduction in Norwegian households” (published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2025), analyzed historical data on six types of large household appliances (fridges, freezers, washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, and ovens) in Norway. Contrary to popular belief, the researchers found that product lifetimes are not universally decreasing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For most appliances (fridges, freezers, dishwashers, dryers), the average lifespan has remained stable over the decades.</li>
<li>Two appliances showed a significant drop in lifespan: washing machines (dropped ~45%) and ovens (dropped ~39%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did Washing Machines and Ovens decline? Since the study dismisses “planned obsolescence” as the primary cause, it offers alternative explanations for the two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Washing Machines: The decline in years is likely due to increased usage intensity. Households wash clothes much more frequently today than in the past. While the machine lasts fewer years, it might still be delivering a similar number of wash cycles before wearing out.</li>
<li>Ovens: The decline is largely social, not technical. A high percentage (~40%) of ovens are discarded while still functioning, often due to kitchen renovations. As the kitchen became a social hub, consumers began replacing ovens for aesthetic reasons rather than mechanical failure.</li>
