I have always been interested in statistics, and I wanted to break down these concepts in a way that was easy to understand but went into enough detail to be useful.\n\n\nA Brief Introduction to Intelligence\nI wrote/compiled this book as a way to introduce people to the field of intelligence research and its criticisms. I have always been interested in the field of intelligence research, and I wanted to share my knowledge with others. I also wanted to make a book that was easy but robustly cited."
