        <p>
            Even though Alan was the only child not to take piano lessons, that did not stop him from pursuing piano. Alan learned piano by ear and learned from mimicking YouTube videos.   

            In highschool, he was involved in the marching band, learning how to play the keyboard, battery, and auxiliary percussion. He was also involved in chorus as a tenor and bass, singing for the varsity choir.

            Alan joined a band where he played the drumset and keyboard, though it was pretty short-lived.

            During this time, he learned how to effectively communicate with others, work in a team, and solve problems. He also improved his Spanish to speak fluently.

            He even won a few hackathons!
