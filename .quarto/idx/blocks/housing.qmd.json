When landlords cannot raise rents to cover costs, they simply stop fixing things\n\n> The published studies are almost unanimous... rent control leads to a deterioration in the quality of those dwellings subject to regulations. The landlords, whose revenues are eroded by rent control, have reduced incentives to invest in maintenance and refurbishment, thus they let their properties wear out until the real value of the dwellings decreases\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2024, pp. 6]\n\nOnce the housing supply dries up, tenants become prisoners of their cheap leases, damaging the broader economy. This creates a \"mismatch.\" An elderly widow might stay in a huge family apartment because it’s cheap, while a young family is squeezed into a small unit. This hurts the labor market because people won't move for better jobs, or changing families.\n\n> The impact on residential mobility appears to be quite clear: nearly all studies indicate a negative effect... Reduced residential mobility translates to less adaptable responses to shifts in the labor market. When economic conditions worsen in their city, tenants in controlled dwellings are less inclined to move to areas with more promising employment prospects\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2024, pp. 5]\n\nThose who are financially disadvantaged may actually be worse off with rent control.\n\n> Despite the intention of rent control to assist low-income households, the actual outcome can be more advantageous for individuals with higher incomes. This stems from the policy’s concentration on regulating dwellings rather than the occupants’ income levels... [and] has the potential to exacerbate inequality by disproportionately favoring more affluent households.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2024, pp. 4]\n\n**Rent control hurts even those who are not directly targeted by the policy**\n\nWhile insiders enjoy capped rents, rent control leads to an average 4.8% increase (estimated effects between -2% to 14.8%) for everyone else in the uncontrolled sector:\n\n> As a rule, rent control leads to higher rents for uncontrolled dwellings. The average effect of rent control on... uncontrolled rents is 4.8%.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2024, pp. 5]\n\n![Uncontrolled rents](images/housing/uncontrolled_rent.jpg){fig-cap=\"Impact on uncontrolled rents\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\nRent control depresses new construction and shrinks the rental stock, often through the conversion of units to owner-occupancy. By restricting supply, rent control transforms housing from a market good into a rationed privilege.\n\n> Rent control can also negatively affect the overall supply of housing... Approximately two-thirds of the studies indicate a negative impact [on construction]. Landlords might take various actions, such as... attempting to convert their rental properties into owner-occupied homes, and constructing fewer new rental housing units.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2024, pp. 1, 6]\n\n## Protection of Tenants from Eviction\n*Rules making eviction more difficult, such as automatic contract prolongation or prohibiting lease breakage except for specific reasons*\n\n> By far the largest group of studies of eviction protection finds eviction-reducing effect. However, the number of studies on protection of tenants from evictions is very small.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 14]\n\n\n\n## Housing Rationing\n*Measures to manipulate supply and demand during shortages, including anti-speculation laws, mobility restrictions, and bans on short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb restrictions)*\n\n>  Likewise, the number of studies on housing rationing is small. They find a negative effect on property prices. Most of these studies refer to the recent policies prohibiting or restricting shortterm rentals on platforms like Airbnb, as authorities suspect that these remove dwellings from the long-term rental housing market.\n\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 14-15]\n\n\n# Stimulating Housing Policies\n\n![](images/housing/stimulating_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Stimulating Housing Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Housing Allowances\n*State subsidies paid to low-income households or landlords to cover housing costs*\n\n> The numbers of studies that find positive and negative effects [about housing allowances on employment] are comparable, while the largest group of studies did not find any statistically significant effects... The housing allowances appear to increase rents... The housing allowances also seem to not just improve neighbourhood and housing quality but also increase housing size. They positively contribute to the mental health. Housing benefits can also lead to smaller household sizes by allowing the women to leave their partners in case of conflicts, since they are become less financially dependent.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 15]\n\n## Provision of Social Housing\n*Provision of state-subsidized rental or owner-occupied housing for low-income households*\n\n> Similarly, the most prominent effect of social, or public, housing seems to be the reduction of employment. Again, it is thought that in-kind subsidies, such as social housing, diminish incentives of its receivers to work. Interestingly, unlike the case of housing allowances, social housing appears to exert no positive price effects, probably due to its in-kind nature. Nevertheless, the number of studies is very limited, which undermines the reliability of these findings.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Mortgage Interest Deduction\n*Tax policy allowing homeowners to deduct interest payments from taxable income to encourage homeownership*\n\n> Although it appears to not affect homeownership, it does lead to rising prices... There are some studies showing an improvement in the housing size and construction, but there are also studies that show negative welfare effects. All in all, most empirical studies conclude that mortgage interest deduction fails to achieve its objective.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Homeownership Subsidies\n*Direct subsidies or grants provided to facilitate homeownership*\n\n> The two major effects of homeownership subsidies that are considered in the empirical literature are property prices and urban sprawl. Both seem to be increased by the subsidies\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n# Housing Quality and Sustainability Policies  \n\n![](images/housing/zoning_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Housing Quality and Sustainability Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Building Codes\n*Regulations regarding structural safety, fire safety, sanitation, and energy efficiency*\n\n> The two most prominent effects of building codes are increasing property prices and reducing electricity consumption. The price increases can be explained by two factors... stronger restrictions on building standards drive up construction costs [and second] higher quality [amenities are] eventually (albeit probably not completely) capitalized in the real estate prices.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Land Use Regulations\n*Zoning laws, density restrictions, urban growth boundaries, and minimum lot sizes*\n\nRegulations are often pitched as a way to protect neighborhood character, and evidence suggests they succeed in creating amenities. However, this comes at the direct expense of supply, creating a \"shortage by design\" that inflates prices.\n\n> Land use policies increase property prices and diminish residential construction. On the one hand, by restricting construction they create a shortage of housing, thus, inflating prices. This means a worse affordability of housing. On the other hand, this effect results from the policies creating amenities and improving the neighbourhood quality.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\nBeyond just higher prices, strict zoning creates a structural financial vulnerability. In markets where supply is constrained (inelastic), prices cannot adjust gradually to economic shifts. Instead, they become hypersensitive to central bank policy, leading to sharper boom-and-bust cycles.\n\n> The regional heterogeneity can be partially explained by changes in housing supply, that is, where land is more expensive, house prices are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates... The heterogeneity of policy response is significantly correlated with... housing supply elasticity.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\nMost importantly, longitudinal data reveals that zoning reforms are not symmetrical. While tightening restrictions (downzoning) has immediate negative impacts on the middle class, loosening them (upzoning) is a slower fix that filters down from the top.\n\nReforms that tighten restrictions have a direct, statistically significant negative impact on middle-income affordability:\n\n> Reforms that increase land-use restrictions and lower allowed densities are associated with increased median rents and a reduction in units affordable to middle-income renters.\n> <br>\n> [@stacy_2023, pp. 1]\n\nConversely, reforms that loosen restrictions (upzoning) do successfully add supply (0.8% increase), but this supply materializes slowly (3–9 years) and primarily at the upper end of the price spectrum.\n\n> We find that reforms that loosen restrictions are associated with a statistically significant 0.8% increase in housing supply within three to nine years... This increase occurs predominantly for units at the higher end of the rent price distribution.\n> <br>\n> [@stacy_2023, pp. 1]\n\nThis suggests that while upzoning is the necessary long-term cure for supply shortages, it is not a quick fix for low-income affordability, whereas downzoning actively harms it.\n\n**Consumer preference sometimes contradicts New Urbanist planning goals**\n\nWhile planners often advocate for high-density and connected street grids to reduce sprawl, a meta-analysis of 139 analyses shows that the market often penalizes these features. Consumers frequently pay a premium for lower density and disconnected streets (cul-de-sacs).\n\n> [A] high density... is likely to decrease individual housing prices... The calculated mean coefficient was statistically significant by the effect size ($r$) of .04 [indicating a negative relationship]... Having a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood has been shown to have a positive effect on housing premiums... ($r = .05$)... [whereas] street density... was negatively related to housing values ($r = -.02$).\n> <br>\n[@park_2016, pp. 3, 6, 7]\n\nThis creates a tension where zoning for density may lower per-unit housing costs not just by increasing supply, but because buyers simply prefer lower-density environments.\n\n> [P]eople are less likely to invest in houses in higher density neighborhoods... high density can be perceived as a crowded environment and prone to causing stress... [P]eople still value large lots, lower density... and secluded space with less connected streets over most New Urbanism principles.\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 7, 9]\n\nProximity to institutional land uses (like schools or government buildings) tends to increase housing values, while proximity to industrial uses decreases them. However, generic \"mixed-use\" zoning does not automatically generate value.\n\n> Being closer to institutional land uses increases housing premiums... [However] a large distribution of industrial land uses has negative effects... The larger the industrial land use, the lower the housing values ($r = -.09$)... Commercial land use showed insignificant effects ($r = .00$).\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 5, 7]\n\nWhile urbanists often promote mixed-use developments as a way to increase value and walkability, the actual market data is highly conflicted. The \"premium\" depends entirely on the specific type of non-residential use.\n\n> Mixed land use was reported as both a positive and a negative condition... Being closer to institutional land uses [like schools] increases housing premiums... [while] a large distribution of industrial land uses has negative effects... Commercial land use showed insignificant effects ($r = .00$).\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 3, 5, 7]\n\n## Green Subsidies and Green Building Standards\n*Policies promoting energy-saving measures, such as insulation or solar battery installation*\n\n> There are still relatively few studies on the effects of green housing policies. The effects found in this literature are rather ambiguous.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n**Transit-Oriented Development**\n\n*Development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport*\n\nUnlike density or street connectivity, proximity to public transit is a \"New Urbanist\" feature that the market consistently values positively, particularly within a quarter-mile radius.\n\n> [B]eing located close to transit stops is a positive condition that increases housing values in general, but it becomes more effective when a property is located within a quarter-mile radius... properties within a quarter-mile distance... were likely to have a higher housing value ($r = .03$) than beyond this distance, while a half-mile ($r = .01$) was not a significant condition.\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 7]\n\n\n# Taxation of Real Estate\n\n![](images/housing/tax_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Taxation of Real Estate\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Transaction Taxes\n*Taxes paid upon the transfer of property title, such as stamp duties*\n\n>The welfare costs of introducing or eliminating a housing transaction tax are small... While property taxes simply extract wealth from the original homeowner, transaction taxes can have more subtle, potentially positive effects.\n[@zhao_2023, pp. 6-7]\n\n## Property Tax\n*Recurrent annual tax levied on the owner of real estate*\n\nOn one hand, taxing property serves as a disincentive for developers, creating a drag on new supply.\n\n> [P]roperty tax seems to reduce [residential construction]\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\nHowever, other literature suggests that without this tax, markets become prone to bubbles. The tax acts as a necessary friction against hoarding and speculation, even if it slightly dampens construction.\n\n> Property taxes are considered to simply extract wealth from the original homeowner... [However], residential property taxes or higher interest rates effectively dampen speculative housing transactions, having a long-term effect on the taming of house prices.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 8]\n\nUnlike other interventions, taxes can actually work to stabilize prices, but they cannot replace supply-side fixes.\n\n> To curb soaring house prices, at least in the short term, property taxes should not be used to replace purchase restrictions... housing prices do not respond to large cuts in state property taxes.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\n\n## Improvement Fees (Impact Fees)\n*Fees levied on developers or property owners to fund public infrastructure projects associated with new developments*\n\n> [I]mprovement fees [have] effect[s that are predominantly] positive, because the fee revenues are invested in infrastructure improvements that increase housing prices\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Vacancy Tax\n*Taxes imposed on empty properties to encourage owners to activate unused housing stock by selling or renting it out*\n\n> In case of vacancy taxes, the evidence is rather mixed [regarding housing prices]... vacancy... taxes appear to increase [residential construction]\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Foreign-Buyer Tax\n*Targeted transfer taxes on non-resident purchasers intended to discourage foreign speculative demand*\n\n> [F]oreign-buyer taxes appear to increase [residential construction]\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n# Macroprudential Regulations\n\n![](images/housing/macroprud_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Macroprudential Regulations\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Borrower-Targeted Policies\n*Policies aimed at borrowers’ leverage and financial positions, including caps on debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and amortization requirements*[^dti_ltv]\n\nBorrower-targeted macroprudential regulations like LTV (Loan-to-Value) and DTI (Debt-to-Income) limits are effective for stability, and are among the only policies that work in both the short and long term.\n\n> Macro-prudential policies can effectively restrain house prices and household credit growth in both the short and long terms... Borrower-based regulatory policies, such as reducing LTV or DTI limits, can effectively curb housing booms.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\nBy restricting the flow of credit rather than the price of the asset, these policies are effective at cooling demand without distorting the construction market as severely as price controls.\n\n> Changes in down-payment requirements effectively dampen house price cycles... Credit availability can be reduced and leveraged to ease the housing price cycle.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\n## Financial-Institutions-Targeted Policies\n*Policies aimed at financial institutions’ assets or liabilities to tackle systemic risk, such as capital buffers, leverage ratios, and liquidity requirements*\n\n> [F]inancial-institutions-targeted policies are policies aimed at financial institutions’ assets or liabilities (limits on domestic currency loans... countercyclical capital buffers... [and] liquidity requirements/buffers...)... exert negative impacts on prices and loans.\n> <br>\n[@kholodilin_2025, pp. 10, 19]\n\n# Macroeconomic Policies\n\n![](images/housing/macroecon_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Macroeconomic Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Fiscal Policy\n*Government use of spending and taxation to influence economic conditions and aggregate demand*\n\nWhen the government spends heavily, it competes for the same labor and materials as private developers (\"crowding out\") and drives up interest rates. This makes it harder for the private sector to build housing.\n\n> Fiscal policy appears to positively affect property prices, while negatively affecting residential construction. The first effect can be explained by the inflationary impact of government expenditure, whereas the second effect is possibly related to the crowding out of the government consumption. An expansionary fiscal policy triggers increases in both prices and interest rates. Consequently, private investors face heightened costs, leading to a reduced willingness to build\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 19]\n\n\n## Monetary Policy\n*Central bank actions managing interest rates and money supply to influence inflation and economic activity*\n\nMonetary policy presents a distinct trade-off between stimulating supply and inflating prices. On one hand, lower interest rates reduce the cost of capital, which successfully encourages developers to build more homes.\n\n> Monetary policy... increases housing rents and purchase prices while fostering growth in the housing construction sector... The boost in housing construction can be explained by the lower interest rates, which alleviate the interest burden and decrease the opportunity costs for investors.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 19]\n\nHowever, this liquidity often flows into speculation rather than productive output. While construction may rise, the \"cheap money\" simultaneously inflates asset prices, often cancelling out affordability gains and creating instability.\n\n> The impact of money supply expansion has stimulated the property sector, but only in the short-term, with little impact on prices... Loose monetary conditions can lead to a surge in real estate lending and a housing price bubble.\n> <br>\n[@zhao_2023, pp. 6]\n\nUltimately, while useful for short-term stimulation, relying on monetary policy risks decoupling housing prices from economic fundamentals.\n\n> An expansionary monetary policy tends to accelerate subsequent house price rises, while a restrictive monetary policy tends to slow down subsequent house price rises... There is a significant correlation between monetary policy and asset pricing bubbles.\n> <br>\n[@zhao_2023, pp. 10]\n\n\n\n\n\n# Labour Market Policies\n\n![](images/housing/labour_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Labour Market Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Minimum Wage\n*Labor market regulations setting the lowest legal remuneration employers can pay workers*\n\n> According to the literature, the major effect of minimum wage regulation is its positive impact on housing rents.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 21]\n\n\n## Unemployment Benefits\n*State-provided financial aid to individuals who have lost their jobs to support income stability*\n\n> Unemployment benefits are much less investigated. It is not clear whether unemployment benefits allow reducing the number of foreclosures, although it provides monetary aid to people in financial distress.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 21]\n\n\n## Job Protection\n*Regulations limiting the ability of employers to dismiss workers, aimed at increasing income security*\n\n> Of the few studies conducted, most conclude that job protection leads to an increase in mortgage amounts. By preventing the layoffs of employees, this regulation supports the demand for housing and, hence, for mortgage loans.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 21]\n\n\n[^dti_ltv]: **Debt-to-Income (DTI)** measures the percentage of a borrower's gross monthly income that goes toward paying debts. <br><br>**Loan-to-Value (LTV)** compares the mortgage loan amount to the appraised value of the property. <br><br>**Lowering** these limits (tighter policy) forces buyers to have higher incomes or larger down payments, which restricts credit and cools demand. <br><br>**Raising** these limits (looser policy) allows buyers to leverage more debt, increasing purchasing power but also the risk of default and asset bubbles.\n\n[^chart_key]: This and the below figures like this show the overall effects and their direction of restrictive rental housing policies. The policy tools are split in several subgroups, showing each in a separate figure. Each row corresponds to an effect, while each column refers to a policy. Above each column, the number of studies that investigate effects of the corresponding policy is reported. Given that some studies consider effect of several policies (e.g., social housing and housing allowances), the sum of these numbers exceeds the total number of studies examined here. The length of each bar reflects the relative attention devoted by researchers to the corresponding pair policy-effect as measured by the number of studies that investigate it. For each policy tool, this number of studies is divided by the total number of studies inspecting this policy tool. The colour of bars shows the direction of the effect. Green (red) colour denotes studies that found statistically significant positive (negative) effects. Yellow colour denotes studies that did not find any statistically significant effect of the policy.\n\n\nread later:\n\nhttps://jice.um.edu.my/index.php/JSCP/article/view/48252\nhttps://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1758056&dswid=1740\nhttps://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Overview-Talk-Panel-5.pdf\nhttps://www.europeanproceedings.com/article/10.15405/epfe.23081.18\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5764596\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09718907241248493","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Restrictive Rental Housing Policies\n\n![](images/housing/restrictive_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Restrictive Rental Housing Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"} [^chart_key]\n\n\n## Rent Control\n*Regulations protecting tenants from rental increases, including rent freezes and caps on rent growth*\n\n> The most prominent effects of rent control are decline of rents for controlled dwellings, reduced residential mobility, lower construction, lower quality of housing, higher rents for uncontrolled dwellings, and lower property prices.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 14]\n\n\n**Rent control hurts those directly \"helped\" by the policy**\n\nPrice ceilings act as quality ceilings.

While tightening restrictions (downzoning) has immediate negative impacts on the middle class, loosening them (upzoning) is a slower fix that filters down from the top.\n\nReforms that tighten restrictions have a direct, statistically significant negative impact on middle-income affordability:\n\n> Reforms that increase land-use restrictions and lower allowed densities are associated with increased median rents and a reduction in units affordable to middle-income renters.\n> <br>\n> [@stacy_2023, pp. 1]\n\nConversely, reforms that loosen restrictions (upzoning) do successfully add supply (0.8% increase), but this supply materializes slowly (3–9 years) and primarily at the upper end of the price spectrum.\n\n> We find that reforms that loosen restrictions are associated with a statistically significant 0.8% increase in housing supply within three to nine years... This increase occurs predominantly for units at the higher end of the rent price distribution.\n> <br>\n> [@stacy_2023, pp. 1]\n\nThis suggests that while upzoning is the necessary long-term cure for supply shortages, it is not a quick fix for low-income affordability, whereas downzoning actively harms it.\n\n**Consumer preference sometimes contradicts New Urbanist planning goals**\n\nWhile planners often advocate for high-density and connected street grids to reduce sprawl, a meta-analysis of 139 analyses shows that the market often penalizes these features. Consumers frequently pay a premium for lower density and disconnected streets (cul-de-sacs).\n\n> [A] high density... is likely to decrease individual housing prices... The calculated mean coefficient was statistically significant by the effect size ($r$) of .04 [indicating a negative relationship]... Having a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood has been shown to have a positive effect on housing premiums... ($r = .05$)... [whereas] street density... was negatively related to housing values ($r = -.02$).\n> <br>\n[@park_2016, pp. 3, 6, 7]\n\nThis creates a tension where zoning for density may lower per-unit housing costs not just by increasing supply, but because buyers simply prefer lower-density environments.\n\n> [P]eople are less likely to invest in houses in higher density neighborhoods... high density can be perceived as a crowded environment and prone to causing stress... [P]eople still value large lots, lower density... and secluded space with less connected streets over most New Urbanism principles.\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 7, 9]\n\nProximity to institutional land uses (like schools or government buildings) tends to increase housing values, while proximity to industrial uses decreases them. However, generic \"mixed-use\" zoning does not automatically generate value.\n\n> Being closer to institutional land uses increases housing premiums... [However] a large distribution of industrial land uses has negative effects... The larger the industrial land use, the lower the housing values ($r = -.09$)... Commercial land use showed insignificant effects ($r = .00$).\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 5, 7]\n\nWhile urbanists often promote mixed-use developments as a way to increase value and walkability, the actual market data is highly conflicted. The \"premium\" depends entirely on the specific type of non-residential use.\n\n> Mixed land use was reported as both a positive and a negative condition... Being closer to institutional land uses [like schools] increases housing premiums... [while] a large distribution of industrial land uses has negative effects... Commercial land use showed insignificant effects ($r = .00$).\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 3, 5, 7]\n\n## Green Subsidies and Green Building Standards\n*Policies promoting energy-saving measures, such as insulation or solar battery installation*\n\n> There are still relatively few studies on the effects of green housing policies. The effects found in this literature are rather ambiguous.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n**Transit-Oriented Development**\n\n*Development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport*\n\nUnlike density or street connectivity, proximity to public transit is a \"New Urbanist\" feature that the market consistently values positively, particularly within a quarter-mile radius.\n\n> [B]eing located close to transit stops is a positive condition that increases housing values in general, but it becomes more effective when a property is located within a quarter-mile radius... properties within a quarter-mile distance... were likely to have a higher housing value ($r = .03$) than beyond this distance, while a half-mile ($r = .01$) was not a significant condition.\n> <br>\n> [@park_2016, pp. 7]\n\n\n# Taxation of Real Estate\n\n![](images/housing/tax_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Taxation of Real Estate\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Transaction Taxes\n*Taxes paid upon the transfer of property title, such as stamp duties*\n\n>The welfare costs of introducing or eliminating a housing transaction tax are small... While property taxes simply extract wealth from the original homeowner, transaction taxes can have more subtle, potentially positive effects.\n[@zhao_2023, pp. 6-7]\n\n## Property Tax\n*Recurrent annual tax levied on the owner of real estate*\n\nOn one hand, taxing property serves as a disincentive for developers, creating a drag on new supply.\n\n> [P]roperty tax seems to reduce [residential construction]\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\nHowever, other literature suggests that without this tax, markets become prone to bubbles. The tax acts as a necessary friction against hoarding and speculation, even if it slightly dampens construction.\n\n> Property taxes are considered to simply extract wealth from the original homeowner... [However], residential property taxes or higher interest rates effectively dampen speculative housing transactions, having a long-term effect on the taming of house prices.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 8]\n\nUnlike other interventions, taxes can actually work to stabilize prices, but they cannot replace supply-side fixes.\n\n> To curb soaring house prices, at least in the short term, property taxes should not be used to replace purchase restrictions... housing prices do not respond to large cuts in state property taxes.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\n\n## Improvement Fees (Impact Fees)\n*Fees levied on developers or property owners to fund public infrastructure projects associated with new developments*\n\n> [I]mprovement fees [have] effect[s that are predominantly] positive, because the fee revenues are invested in infrastructure improvements that increase housing prices\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Vacancy Tax\n*Taxes imposed on empty properties to encourage owners to activate unused housing stock by selling or renting it out*\n\n> In case of vacancy taxes, the evidence is rather mixed [regarding housing prices]... vacancy... taxes appear to increase [residential construction]\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n## Foreign-Buyer Tax\n*Targeted transfer taxes on non-resident purchasers intended to discourage foreign speculative demand*\n\n> [F]oreign-buyer taxes appear to increase [residential construction]\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 16]\n\n# Macroprudential Regulations\n\n![](images/housing/macroprud_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Macroprudential Regulations\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Borrower-Targeted Policies\n*Policies aimed at borrowers’ leverage and financial positions, including caps on debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and amortization requirements*[^dti_ltv]\n\nBorrower-targeted macroprudential regulations like LTV (Loan-to-Value) and DTI (Debt-to-Income) limits are effective for stability, and are among the only policies that work in both the short and long term.\n\n> Macro-prudential policies can effectively restrain house prices and household credit growth in both the short and long terms... Borrower-based regulatory policies, such as reducing LTV or DTI limits, can effectively curb housing booms.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\nBy restricting the flow of credit rather than the price of the asset, these policies are effective at cooling demand without distorting the construction market as severely as price controls.\n\n> Changes in down-payment requirements effectively dampen house price cycles... Credit availability can be reduced and leveraged to ease the housing price cycle.\n> <br>\n> [@zhao_2023, pp. 7]\n\n## Financial-Institutions-Targeted Policies\n*Policies aimed at financial institutions’ assets or liabilities to tackle systemic risk, such as capital buffers, leverage ratios, and liquidity requirements*\n\n> [F]inancial-institutions-targeted policies are policies aimed at financial institutions’ assets or liabilities (limits on domestic currency loans... countercyclical capital buffers... [and] liquidity requirements/buffers...)... exert negative impacts on prices and loans.\n> <br>\n[@kholodilin_2025, pp. 10, 19]\n\n# Macroeconomic Policies\n\n![](images/housing/macroecon_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Macroeconomic Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Fiscal Policy\n*Government use of spending and taxation to influence economic conditions and aggregate demand*\n\nWhen the government spends heavily, it competes for the same labor and materials as private developers (\"crowding out\") and drives up interest rates. This makes it harder for the private sector to build housing.\n\n> Fiscal policy appears to positively affect property prices, while negatively affecting residential construction. The first effect can be explained by the inflationary impact of government expenditure, whereas the second effect is possibly related to the crowding out of the government consumption. An expansionary fiscal policy triggers increases in both prices and interest rates. Consequently, private investors face heightened costs, leading to a reduced willingness to build\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 19]\n\n\n## Monetary Policy\n*Central bank actions managing interest rates and money supply to influence inflation and economic activity*\n\nMonetary policy presents a distinct trade-off between stimulating supply and inflating prices. On one hand, lower interest rates reduce the cost of capital, which successfully encourages developers to build more homes.\n\n> Monetary policy... increases housing rents and purchase prices while fostering growth in the housing construction sector... The boost in housing construction can be explained by the lower interest rates, which alleviate the interest burden and decrease the opportunity costs for investors.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 19]\n\nHowever, this liquidity often flows into speculation rather than productive output. While construction may rise, the \"cheap money\" simultaneously inflates asset prices, often cancelling out affordability gains and creating instability.\n\n> The impact of money supply expansion has stimulated the property sector, but only in the short-term, with little impact on prices... Loose monetary conditions can lead to a surge in real estate lending and a housing price bubble.\n> <br>\n[@zhao_2023, pp. 6]\n\nUltimately, while useful for short-term stimulation, relying on monetary policy risks decoupling housing prices from economic fundamentals.\n\n> An expansionary monetary policy tends to accelerate subsequent house price rises, while a restrictive monetary policy tends to slow down subsequent house price rises... There is a significant correlation between monetary policy and asset pricing bubbles.\n> <br>\n[@zhao_2023, pp. 10]\n\n\n\n\n\n# Labour Market Policies\n\n![](images/housing/labour_housing.png){fig-cap=\"Effects of Labour Market Policies\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Minimum Wage\n*Labor market regulations setting the lowest legal remuneration employers can pay workers*\n\n> According to the literature, the major effect of minimum wage regulation is its positive impact on housing rents.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 21]\n\n\n## Unemployment Benefits\n*State-provided financial aid to individuals who have lost their jobs to support income stability*\n\n> Unemployment benefits are much less investigated. It is not clear whether unemployment benefits allow reducing the number of foreclosures, although it provides monetary aid to people in financial distress.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 21]\n\n\n## Job Protection\n*Regulations limiting the ability of employers to dismiss workers, aimed at increasing income security*\n\n> Of the few studies conducted, most conclude that job protection leads to an increase in mortgage amounts. By preventing the layoffs of employees, this regulation supports the demand for housing and, hence, for mortgage loans.\n> <br>\n> [@kholodilin_2025, pp. 21]\n\n\n[^dti_ltv]: **Debt-to-Income (DTI)** measures the percentage of a borrower's gross monthly income that goes toward paying debts. <br><br>**Loan-to-Value (LTV)** compares the mortgage loan amount to the appraised value of the property. <br><br>**Lowering** these limits (tighter policy) forces buyers to have higher incomes or larger down payments, which restricts credit and cools demand. <br><br>**Raising** these limits (looser policy) allows buyers to leverage more debt, increasing purchasing power but also the risk of default and asset bubbles.\n\n[^chart_key]: This and the below figures like this show the overall effects and their direction of restrictive rental housing policies. The policy tools are split in several subgroups, showing each in a separate figure. Each row corresponds to an effect, while each column refers to a policy. Above each column, the number of studies that investigate effects of the corresponding policy is reported. Given that some studies consider effect of several policies (e.g., social housing and housing allowances), the sum of these numbers exceeds the total number of studies examined here. The length of each bar reflects the relative attention devoted by researchers to the corresponding pair policy-effect as measured by the number of studies that investigate it. For each policy tool, this number of studies is divided by the total number of studies inspecting this policy tool. The colour of bars shows the direction of the effect. Green (red) colour denotes studies that found statistically significant positive (negative) effects. Yellow colour denotes studies that did not find any statistically significant effect of the policy.\n\n\nread
