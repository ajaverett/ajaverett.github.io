Incline Dumbbell Press** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets upper chest. |\n| **2. Barbell Squat** | 3 | 6-8 | Targets quads, adductors, glutes. |\n| **3. Chest-Supported DB Row** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets mid/upper back. |\n| **4. Seated Leg Curl** | 3 | 10-15 | Targets hamstrings (knee flexion). |\n| **5. Bicep Curl** (Superset) | 3 | 8-12 | See options below. |\n| **6. Tricep Extension** (Superset) | 3 | 8-12 | See options below. |\n\n\n\n### 💡 Form & Technique Tips\n\n* **Incline Dumbbell Press:**\n    * **Bench Angle:** If you have a flat sternum, use a slight incline (1-2 notches). If you have a steep sternal angle, use a steeper incline. [@chaves_2020]\n    * **Elbows:** Tuck elbows into an arrow shape; press up and back towards the collarbone.\n    * **Warm-up:** 1 light set (8-10 reps), 1 medium (3-5 reps), 1 heavy (1-2 reps).\n* **Squats:**\n    * Squats will grow glutes as effectively as other glute focused exercises (hip thrust) but also grow the quads, adductors, and lower back. [@plotkin_2023]\n    * **Modifications:** If you struggle to squat deep (long femurs/poor ankle mobility), elevate your heels on plates to target quads more effectively.\n    * \n* **Chest-Supported Row:**\n    * **Setup:** Set bench to 45°. Keep elbows angled out like an arrow shape. Make sure to not let the biceps take over by squeezing the back keeping forearms perpendicular to the ground.\n    * **Intensity Technique:** On the last set, after hitting failure, perform 3–5 partial reps in the bottom (stretched) position.\n* **Leg Curl:**\n    * **Seated vs. Lying:** Seated is preferred for greater stretch/growth.\n    * **Tip:** Stop just short of fully straightening legs to keep tension on hamstrings, not calves.\n\n### 💪 Arms Superset Options\n* **Option 1 (Dumbbells):** Lying Incline DB Curls + DB Overhead Extensions.\n* **Option 2 (Cables):** Behind-the-body Cable Curls + Overhead Rope Extensions.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workout B\n**Focus:** Flat Press, Hinge Pattern, Vertical Pull, Glutes\n\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Barbell Bench Press** | 3 | 4-6 | Targets mid/lower chest & strength. |\n| **2. Romanian Deadlift (RDL)** | 3 | 6-8 | Targets hamstrings (hip extension). |\n| **3. Lat Pulldowns** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets lats/upper back width. |\n| **4. Walking Lunges** | 3 | 6-10 | Reps are *per leg*. Glute focus. |\n| **5. Cable Lateral Raise** (Superset) | 3 | 10-15 | Side delts. |\n| **6. Reverse Crunches** (Superset) | 3 | 10-15 | Abdominal focus. |\n\n\n\n### 💡 Form & Technique Tips\n\n* **Bench Press:**\n    * Heavier weight (lower reps) to boost strength.\n    * *Alternative:* Flat Dumbbell Press if the barbell bothers your shoulders.\n* **Romanian Deadlift:**\n    * **Cue:** Imagine a band around your hips pulling you back. Let the bar slide down your thighs.\n    * **Depth:** Stop when your hips stop moving back to avoid rounding the lower back.\n* **Lat Pulldowns:**\n    * **Grip:** Fairly wide grip, lean back slightly.\n    * **Intensity Technique:** On the last set, extend the set with 3–5 partial reps in the stretched position after failure.\n* **Walking Lunges:**\n    * **Glute Focus:** Take a wide step and lean your torso forward slightly while keeping the back straight.\n* **Superset:**\n    * **Lateral Raise:** Set cable 3-4 notches up from the bottom for a better resistance profile. Perform behind the back.\n    * **Reverse Crunches:** Curl pelvis up towards chest; control the descent.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Workout C\n**Focus:** Vertical Press, Horizontal Pull (Lats), Quads/Glutes Isolation\n\n| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1. Seated DB Shoulder Press** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets front delts. |\n| **2. Single-Arm DB Row** | 3 | 8-12 | Targets lats. |\n| **3. Hip Thrusts** | 3 | 10-15 | Targets glutes (shortened position). |\n| **4. Leg Extensions** | 3 | 10-15 | Targets Rectus Femoris (quad). |\n| **5. Cable Flyes** | 3 | 10-15 | Chest isolation/stretch. |\n| **6. Standing Calf Raise** (Superset) | 3 | 10-15 | Targets calves. |\n| **7. Reverse Cable Flyes** (Superset) | 3 | 10-15 | Targets rear delts. |\n\n\n\n[Image of seated dumbbell shoulder press]\n\n\n### 💡 Form & Technique Tips\n\n* **Shoulder Press:**\n    * Set bench 1-2 notches down from fully upright (better for joints).\n    * Flare elbows slightly on the way up, tuck slightly in front on the way down.\n* **DB Row:**\n    * **Lat Focus:** Keep elbow tight to the side. drive the elbow back towards the hip in an arcing motion.\n    * **Intensity Technique:** 3–5 partial reps in the stretched position on the final set.\n    * \n* **Hip Thrusts:**\n    * *Alternative:* Dumbbell Step-ups (lean forward for glutes).\n* **Leg Extensions:**\n    * Lean back in the seat (if possible) to stretch the rectus femoris for more growth.\n* **Cable Flyes:**\n    * Place a foam roller behind your back for a deeper stretch.\n    * *Alternative:* Pec Deck (add partial reps at the end if using Pec Deck).\n* **Superset:**\n    * **Calf Raise:** Pause at the bottom for a deep stretch.\n    * **Rear Delt Fly:** Set cables slightly above shoulder height; cross arms at the start.\n\n---\n\n**Progressive Overload:**\nAim to increase weight or reps slightly every week.
